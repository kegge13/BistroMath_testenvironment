In these cases the scan angle was set to 90 degrees for these scans. This should be 45 or 135 degrees for true diagonal scans. Also, BistroMath now relies on its own calculation of the scanangle and overrides any scan angle information in a data file. Due to this switch in strategy there might be a mixup in the reference files: possibly files with '045' have to be renamed to 135 and vice versa.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><I>version 3.00, 13/10/2016</I></FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">This version extends widely the possibilities for multiple references in a single file. Where in previous versions this feature was limited to files with a fixed structure, now any file can be used by creating an </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs135.htm#ReferenceIndexing">index to the file</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">. Note that, by definition, these files cannot be loaded automatically. Also all supported binary files now are accepted as reference file. In previous versions only one singe scan from a binary file was taken. Please read the new </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs2.htm">overview topic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">All data file access was reviewed. Now always the data are placed in a memory stream immediately, which is more efficient for repeatedly opening the same data. In the alpha release one bug appeared here: when changing to another multi-reference file the stream was appended to the existing stream in stead of replaced.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Now any supported file including binary types can be used as reference. This opens the opportunity to open an unstructured </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs900.htm#OmniPro_rfb">rfb</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> or </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs900.htm#mcc_ascii">mcc</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> file as </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs135.htm#ReferenceIndexing">reference</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The alpha state of this version only is related to data reading and reference selection strategy. When new bugs are introduced they are only related to failed reading of data or not using the correct reference in exotic circumstances. The analysis as such has not been changed.</FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">PTW has updated the application BeamAdjust (we have now version 1.9.2.16). In previous versions the scan depth was set at a fixed value of 0.00 mm. In the new version you can set it to the actual depth. This might make old references invalid as they are still set to a depth of 0. The most sensible solution is to mass edit all reference and/or measurement files. I found <B>fnr.exe</B> (https://findandreplace.codeplex.com). This works straightforward. Search for mcc files (*.mcc) and do a find/replace for "SCAN_DEPTH=0.00" with "SCAN_DEPTH=50.00". There is no need to rename the reference files.</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Standard non-alpha release. One serious flaw was found. There was possible loss of reference files due to the usage of multi-scan references.

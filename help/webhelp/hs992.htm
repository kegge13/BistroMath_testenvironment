<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The introduction of FFF beams introduces new phenomena when changing beam parameters. In the discussions at my clinic this led to the conclusion that analysis based on the origin as beam center could be helpful. In the design of BistroMath the center was <I>always</I> defined as the avarage of left and right penumbra.&nbsp;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In a new </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs128.htm">help topic</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> all issues related to beam center and normalisation are presented.&nbsp;</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Bug report by user for reading and writing MCC files: new found values for the REF_SCAN_POSITIONS list were added to the already available values. Therefore this list would grow indefinitely. Because this list is not actively used in BistroMath but just stored for convenience when when writing MCC data, the same list would also grow in the written files. The effects, beside an increasing file length, for PTW software are unknown, but probably minor.</FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">More explicit error messaging for wrong references. When the contents of a reference file are conflicting with its file name the reference is not used. This might be the case for inconsistent multi scan file references when the first scan header information is inconsistent with subsequent scan headers. Now, to surprise of the user, BistroMath will rightfully reject the reference for the second scan.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">While testing on other data the pdd model for photons showed to lead to a oscillating result. Despite recent code reviews the implementation of the Nelder-Mead optimisation worked flawless. It was the model itself that became unstable. This oscillation, induced by the buildup term, is now effectively dampened by introducing a buildup power factor in the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs400.htm#JWmodel">photon model</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">. The improvement is quit spectacular.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">After initial failing attempts to optimise also the buildup power factor now only the deviation from 1 (effectively no power factor) is included in the Nelder-Mead optimisation. When this still leads to unstable results the power factor can set fixed to any value between 1 and 2.&nbsp; Also the Error to Noise Ratio is now added to the cost function. Both measures improve the outcome fully automatically in most cases. Alternatively some manual steering can be done.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><I>version 2.85, build 473, 04/01/2016</I></FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Testing on a predefined error value when this was set by the defined cost function attached to the Nelder-Mead module proved to be unreliable when comparing extreme values of floating point variables. This mechanism is needed to detect illegal combinations of parameters delivered to the cost function. With hindsight failing equality tests induced numerous extra runs of the procedure. In version 2.84 this was repaired by testing on reaching more then 90% of the extreme value. A small typing error was made in this process, leading to a suboptimal pdd fit. This is repaired here.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The space bar is used for quick selection of a graphical element (line or curve).</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Spectacular processing speed improvement for large text-based data (files). This could take up to 5 seconds for a file of 1 MB and, with hindsight, was also noticable for small files.

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Tiny patch: quadratic filtering is applied after addition of two profiles. In a large code review for version 2.80 the data points from both profiles to be added were gathered using a the same routine that is used to evaluate the normalisation point. This makes the influence of both data sources on the result identical. However, the small calculation range used there may pass too much of the original noise.

One missing penumbra would invalidate the calculated center of field and both edge positions. Now any succesfully found edge will be valid. Extra measures to exclude false edges are taken.

The matching area is now limited to provide roughly the same profile values at both sides of the area. An initial calculated optimal shift is used to set a starting value for the cost function. The revised edge detection was needed here to initialise the process on a single edge. The match cost function is now normalised on the number of succesfully matched data points, which avoids poor matches based on few points.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">A minor revision of BistroMath's core function that </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs1022.htm#penumbra_evaluation">evaluates the field borders</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> of a profile. The results of a partial edge detection (see above) are now included in the final analysis results.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">A small improvement of the BistroMath's core function for final analysis. The maximum of a depth dose curve is now fitted with a quadratic fit to evaluate the position and height of the maximum. This might lead to subtle differences with previous versions when the maximum is used for normalisation.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">In early versions of BistroMath the original 3D coordinates of each data point were not stored in memory. On export the shift was applied to the reconstructed 3D coordinates. For these historical reasons the original 3D position data were not updated in previous versions when a shift was applied. This results in a wrong curve when the stored data of a merge (see below) were read as reference. Now all shift related data are updated. The <I>Match</I> function will become somewhat slower because it uses the <I>Shift</I> function frequently. For succesful merging (see below) the 3D-data are needed including any applied shifts. All shift-related code was removed from all export procedures.</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Alignment improved for partial curves: only the valid edges are used.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The division of two curves is done with filtered versions of these curves. The profiles were aligned again after this filtering including a possibly needed match which is time consuming. Now an already matched profile is not matched again.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">All revisions above have been tested carefully and can handle all previously known non-standard situations as well as FFF beams with one missing penumbra. One original file of the .opab type with wedge profiles (toe at the target side, in IEC-601 conventions collimator=0°) was converted to the rfb format within OmniPro. This file was opened in BistroMath and showed the correct wedge orientation. This profile was exported from BistroMath as OmnPro-6-format, PTW .mcc, RFA-300 .asc, wms ascii .wtx and wms binary .wda. Al those files were loaded in BistroMath again succesfully with a correct axis representation.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">As a result of all these revisions, for a FFF beam with one missing penumbra, the available field border will now be given. The field center and field width will still be unavailable.</FONT>

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">With a refinement of the general reading strategy the correct conclusions on the file type are retained when a (possibly multi scan) file does not contain enough data points in a scan. This avoids needless attempts to read with alternative file types. As added bonus, the last displayed status message becomes more meaningful. Now multi scan files which combine real scans with single dose points "scans" can be read succesfully by discarding scans with too few data points automatically. This is the case with </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><A HREF="hs900.htm#mcc_ascii">PTW mcc</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> files generated by the <I>MultiCheck</I> program of PTW.

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Bugfix: The quadratic filter and median filter did not copy the input to output when no repeated filtering was allowed. This would lead to undefined results. However, effects of this to edge detection related behavior, were never observed in previous versions with the tested data sets. Now it was detected on a PTW scan with varying steps from 1 to 4 mm. When combined with the standard filter range of 6 mm this results in a very limited filtering range.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2">"Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behavior of numbers. Just as Albert Einstein's general relativity theory observed that space was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in time, and that time was not an absolute, but dependent on the observer's movement in space, so it is now realised that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants."</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Further explanation of the theory behind bistromathics:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2">"The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or the number of people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has shown up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2">The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of mathematics, including statistics and accountancy, and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="2">The third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table and what they are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this field.)"</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The Bistromath was a ship used by Slartibartfast to save the world from the people of Krikkit. It used the Bistromathic Drive to get through the universe. The inside of the ship looks exactly the same as that of the inside of a italian restaurant and the ships trajectory can be modified by ordering different things on the menu.</FONT><BR>

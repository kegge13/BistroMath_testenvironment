\par 
\par Introduction to version 4.00 and above
\par \b0 The support for x87 processor on the Windows10/64 bits platform is deprecated by Microsoft. As BistroMath no longer is developed on a genuine Windows 32 bits based compiler there are some small effects that \cf3\strike block\cf2\strike0\{linkID=1090\}\cf0  \i exact\i0  reproduction with previous versions.
\par BistroMath supports all parameters introduced in (the prepublication of) \cf1\b NCS-33\cf2\{link=*! ExecFile("https://radiationdosimetry.org/ncs/quality-control-for-linear-accelerators")\}\cf0\b0 .
\par Now multiple data sets can be kept in a \cf3\strike history list\cf2\strike0\{linkID=90\}\cf0 .
\par \b 
\par 
\par Overview\b0 
\par The \cf3\strike BistroMath\cf2\strike0\{linkID=10\}\cf0  application originally was designed to analyse measurements from the OmniPro-Accept software. Versions 6.2A, 6.3, 6.6c, 7.3 and 7.4  have been tested. In BistroMath also the OmniPro \cf3\strike binary file rfb-type\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=OmniPro_rfb\}\cf0 , \cf3\strike PTW\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=mcc_ascii>main\}\cf0  (.mcc) files, \cf3\strike Sun Nuclear text\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=snc_ascii>main\}\cf0  (.snctxt) files \cf4\i [beta-status]\cf0\i0 , SNC clipboard data \cf4\i [alpha-status]\cf0\i0 , Varian w2CAD, Nucletron \cf3\strike wtx and wda\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=wms_ascii\}\cf0  files, CMS/XiO profiles, hdf profiles, Pips-profiles and generic two column data files are accepted. The program hooks up to the chain of clipboard viewers and thus analyses all information which is placed on the clipboard. When a measurement is copied from the OmniPro sytem (or any other source), the data will be found as valid profile data by BistroMath in the clipboard. When available and set as preferred behavior, a reference profile is loaded for comparison. For a inline/crossline scan always the field borders are detected, including profiles fully outside the main axis. Also files with \cf3\strike multiple curves\cf2\strike0\{linkID=50\}\cf0  can be read. For selected 2D-arrays (at this moment only the PTW Starcheck-maxi) a multiprofile dataset can be \cf3\strike stored as reference\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=save_reference\}\cf0 .
\par As means of analysis an optional \cf3\strike gamma analysis\cf2\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  can be calculated when a reference profile is loaded.
\par \cf3\strike Any profile may be stored as reference\cf2\strike0\{linkID=56\}\cf0 . When available and if configured, the measurement will be divided by the reference profile. In this case the flatness of the division curve will be given as a bracketed value, as shown in the example above.
\par The program uses a \cf3\strike fixed axis convention\cf2\strike0\{linkID=12\}\cf0  to store the data internally. This is reflected in the written data files.
\par All reference profiles are resampled to the measurement grid and, for inline/crossline profiles, aligned with the measurement.
\par For depth dose curves \cf3\strike a model can be applied to parameterise the data\cf2\strike0\{linkID=400\}\cf0 . These data are put on the messages tab and are written into several file formats.
\par For any input type OD to dose conversion and / or background correction may be applied. A file conversion tab is added to convert and rename groups of files.
\par \i A more thematic overview can be found in \cf3 concepts\cf2\{linkID=6\}\cf0  and \cf3\strike Comparison with references\cf2\strike0\{linkID=2\}\cf0 .
\par \i0 The \cf3\strike Quick Start guide\cf2\strike0\{linkID=916\}\cf0  attempts to cover the different application areas.
\par The \cf3\strike Results panel\cf2\strike0\{linkID=11\}\cf0  can by completely \cf3\strike configured\cf2\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  by the user. This opens also the opportunity to convert all positions to mm (or microfurlongs). The Dutch NCS-33 publication is fully supported.
\par 
\par \cf2\{bmc bistromath_pdd.gif\}
\par \cf0 For depth dose curves the absolute analysis values and graphic display/relative analysis results have separate, configurable, normalisation points. If this leads to a maximum outside the range 99%-101% the text is altered to "RDD" as shown above. A Nelder-Mead optimisation algorithm is applied to a model to describe depth dose curves.
\par 
\par \b Operation\b0 
\par All three curves Measurement, Reference and Calculation can be toggled with respectively "M", "R" and "C". The vertical indicator lines which show the In-Field area are toggled with "I".
\par Zooming may be done by creating a box in the desired area \cf4 from topleft to bottomright\cf0  with the left mouse button pressed. When the Zoom-item is checked, auto-zooming is done for profiles.
\par Panning is done by creating a box \cf4 from bottomright to topleft\cf0  with the left mouse button pressed or by pressing "U".
\par Values will be shown when the Values-item is checked. Note that there may be small differences as the given \cf4 numbers are the true normalised values\cf0  but the \cf4 graphs are normalised over a small area\cf0  around the normalisation point to give the best graphical alignment.
\par \lang1043 Internally all profiles are stored in \cf3\strike G to T direction, A to B direction and Up to Down direction\cf2\strike0\{linkID=12\}\cf0  respectively to avoid any mixup with different data sources. Therefore the data ordering may be inverted when rewriting data.\lang1033\f1 
\par Please also read the topic on \cf3\strike getting started with FFF\cf2\strike0\{linkID=15\}\cf0 .

\par \lang2057\b\f0\fs20 Beta status limitations\b0 
\par The SNC-clipboard format is based on a private patch which might or might not be published by Sun Nuclear. The Varian format is untested independently.
\par 
\par \b Legal issues\b0 
\par The user and only the user is responsible for his or hers decisions concerning the proper functioning of radiation therapy equipment. This software is merely a tool to support these decisions. With using BistoMath you agree with \cf3\strike these conditions\cf2\strike0\{linkID=1100\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \cf2\b\{target=privacy\}\cf0 Privacy, disk access and communication through internet\b0 
\par This program has no features for data transfer other then to and from a disk location. Only disk locations given by the user will be accessed. BistroMath cannot (and therefore will not) contact any server for any purpose through the internet.
\par 
\par \i Checksum (sha256)\b 
\par \b0\i0 Th checksum is calculated using \cf1\strike https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm#checksums\cf2\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm#checksums")\}\cf0 . This value can be found during the installation procedure and on the website.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\b\f0\fs32 Comparison with references\lang1043\f1  as QA method\lang1033\f0  (overview)\cf0\b0\fs20 
\par 
\par \lang1043\b\f1 Introduction\b0 
\par All QA-protocols currently (2016) only describe classical flattened fields. Both the dose differences within the \i In-Field area\i0  (usually 80% of the nominal field width) and the width of the penumbra region should not exceed certain limits. New developments are upcoming however. 
\par 
\par \cf2\lang2057\f0\{bmc Klein_TG142.gif\}\cf0\lang1043\f1 
\par \i presentation Eric Klein, chair of TG-142\{link=*! ExecFile("http://chapter.aapm.org/seaapm/meetings/2011/S2-T1-Klein-TG-142-Linac-QA.pdf")\}\i0 
\par 
\par This concept has several complications.
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 Small field accelerators like the Elekta Beam Modulator usually have a much more "dome-shaped" field. The \cf3\strike flatness parameter\cf2\strike0\{linkID=5\}\cf0  is typically is 4-5%. This is much more than the normal tolerances.\lang1033\f0 
\par \lang1043\f1{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}It does not work at all for wedged fields.\lang1033\f0 
\par \lang1043\f1{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}It does not work for flattening filter free (FFF) beams.\lang1033\f0 
\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\f1 For all of those fields also the field size definition becomes problematic. As modern treatment planning systems (TPS) can handle non-flat fields effortlessly, linacs should reproduce the configured models in the TPS within tight limits. Both the general accepted tolerances for flatness and the intrinsic (non-)flatness are (much) higher the preferred range of differences with the TPS.
\par 
\par \pard\cf2\{target=relative_flatness\}\lang2057\{bmc selftest_001.gif\}\cf0 
\par \b 
\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\b0 Therefore a comparison of a (measured) field with a \i reference\i0  is the central element in BistroMath. Now a \i relative flatness\i0  can be derived from the calculated \{measurement divided by reference\} profile. With a good QA-regime this relative flatness can be held below 1% under standard conditions and 3% for all gantry angles. As alternative also a \cf3\strike gamma calculation\cf2\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  can be presented.
\par To cope with limitations of the 50% definition for field size, BistroMath has two \cf3\strike alternative methods\cf2\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0 , the maximum of the first derivative and sigmoid fitting.
\par 
\par 
\par \b Concepts of implementation\b0 
\par 
\par \i Automatic loading\i0 
\par Working with references becomes cumbersome and error-prone when this has to be done manually. Therefore Bistromath is able to load a reference from a library based on the name of the scan type, linac, beam, field size, depth and wedge state. This library is a number of files in the \f2\fs18 references\f1\fs20  directory. When \cf3\strike automatic loading of a reference\cf2\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0  is switched \i on\i0 , the appropriate file will be taken from this library, or when a \cf3\strike temporary reference is set\cf2\strike0\{linkID=71\}\cf0 , that will be used.
\par 
\par \i Filling the reference library\i0 
\par Of course, when you start using BistroMath, this library is empty. All needed references must be loaded once and then \cf3\strike stored as reference\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=save_reference\}\cf0 . However, you should \cf3\strike unlock this feature\cf2\strike0\{linkID=56\}\cf0 , since it is locked at start.
\par 
\par \i Types of references\i0 
\par Currently three types of references can be used:
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 Single scans, opened as any \cf3\strike supported file type\cf2\strike0\{linkID=900\}\cf0 , will be stored as \cf3\lang2057\strike OmniPro v6 ascii\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=OmniPro_v6\} \cf0 file in the library with a well-structured name.\lang1043 
\par \lang2057{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Structured scan-sets for supported \cf3\strike 2D-arrays\cf2\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0\lang1043  will be stored in their original format in the library with a well-structured name that includes the type of 2D-array.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Unstructured multi reference files can be loaded as \cf3\strike temporary reference\cf2\strike0\{linkID=71\}\cf0  when \cf3\strike reference indexing\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=referenceIndexing\}\cf0  is switched \i on\i0 . As unstructured files cannot be assigned with a well-structured name there is no automatic mode for loading these files. They can be opened \cf3\strike directly as reference\cf2\strike0\{linkID=50\}\cf0  however.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}A \cf3\strike mirrored version\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=mirroring\}\cf0  of the measurement.
\par \pard\tx200 
\par \cf2\i\{target=intro_BeamLists\}\cf0 Cross-referencing by Generic Beam lists\i0 
\par When a clinic uses generic beam data to describe all beams of the same type (energy, brand, head type) in the clinic measurements of one machine might be compared with another. This can be done by adding an entry in the \cf3\strike aliases tab\cf2\strike0\{linkID=20\}\cf0  as explained below. This establishes a fixed relation between two treatment units. When for different beams also different treatment units are referenced, a separate list is needed. The list is activated in the \cf3\strike Reference menu\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=GenericBeams\}\cf0 . When active, this list is applied before the alias list.
\par 
\par \cf2\i\{target=intro_Aliases\}\cf0 Cross-referencing or correcting data by applying aliases\i0 
\par When a clinic uses generic beam data to describe all beams of the same type (energy, brand, head type) in the clinic measurements of one machine might be compared with another. This can be done by adding an entry in the \cf3\strike aliases tab\cf2\strike0\{linkID=20\}\cf0 , putting the name of treatment unit of the measured data as "Key" and the equivalent reference unit as "Value". This alias is applied whenever any curve identification string is generated. This is fully compatible with automatic loading of references. Note that always the true name of the involved linac is displayed.
\par 
\par \cf2\i\{target=intro_IngoreTU\}\cf0 Cross-referencing by ignoring the treatment unit name\i0 
\par In the \cf3\strike processing menu\cf2\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0  the option to ignore the name of the treatment unit can be activated. By definition this only works for temporary references as there is no way the know the alternatives. 
\par 
\par 
\par \cf2\b\{target=reference_logics\}\cf0 Reference logics\b0 
\par The following rules are applied to use references.
\par 
\par \b 1\b0   Check state of \i Automatic Load of Reference\i0 
\par When this first option in the \cf3\i\strike Reference menu\cf2\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0\i0  is \i not\i0  activated no comparison will be made.
\par \tab\i or\i0 
\par If this option is switched \i on\i0 , continue with step 2.
\par 
\par \b 2\b0   Check temporary reference state
\par \pard If temporary reference file is loaded then check whether this is a single curve ( \'bb 4) or contains multiple scans ( \'bb 3a).
\par \pard\tx200\tab\i or\i0 
\par \pard No temporary reference is available ( \'bb 3b).
\par 
\par \b 3a\b0   A multiple scan reference is loaded
\par If \cf3\strike reference indexing\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=referenceIndexing\}\cf0  is \i on\i0 , then use the internal index to find (and load when found) an alternative scan ( \'bb 4).
\par \pard\tx200\tab\i or\i0 
\par \pard The measurement and reference are of \cf3\strike a known structured multi reference type\cf2\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0  \i and\i0  the\lang1033  \cf3\i\strike Device specific Reference\cf2\i0\strike0\{linkTarget=DeviceSpecificReference\}\cf0  option in \i Reference menu\i0  is switched \i on\i0  to load the scan with the same scan number. The reference name will be derived from a combination of measured values, given parameters in the measurement file and the measurement\lang1043  device name ( \'bb 3b)\lang1033 .
\par 
\par \b 3b\b0   The library is searched for a suitable reference
\par (Note that loading any file is based solely on the name of the file. When active, first the \i Generic Beam list\i0  is applied, then all aliases are applied in this stage.)
\par The measurement is not\lang1043  \cf3\strike a known structured multi reference type\cf2\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0\lang1033 : file identification is based on linac, scan type, beam, field size, depth and wedge state \lang1043 ( \'bb 4)\lang1033 .
\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\tab\i or\i0 
\par \pard The \cf3\lang1033\i\strike Device specific Reference\cf2\i0\strike0\{linkTarget=DeviceSpecificReference\}\cf0  option in \i Reference menu\i0  is switched \i on\i0 : file identification is based on linac, array identification, beam, field size, depth and wedge state. When this file search fails it is reported in the \cf3\strike Messages tab\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=no_2D_ref\}\cf0 . Otherwise the appropriate scan number is loaded from that file \lang1043 ( \'bb 4)\lang1033 .
\par 
\par \b 4\b0   A reference file is loaded
\par The characteristics of the reference are checked against the measurement. Note that all aliases are applied again with the contents of the file.
\par Both scans are seen as identical \lang1043 ( \'bb 5)\lang1033 
\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\tab\i or\i0

\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\tab\i or\i0 
\par \pard\lang1033 The files are not seen as matching \i and\i0  \cf3\strike type checking is switched off\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=check_tempref_type\}\cf0  in the \i Processing\i0  menu the user is willing to accept any outcome \lang1043 ( \'bb 5)\lang1033 
\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\tab\i else\i0 
\par \pard No comparison is made.

\par \pard\lang1043\b\f1 Introduction\lang2057\b0\f0 
\par \lang1043\f1 BistroMath offers a lot of possibilities which can become confusing for the user. Therefore the configuration is organised in three layers of ini-files which reside in the common application data directory  (\f2\fs18 C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\BistroMath\f1\fs20  or \f2\fs18 C:\\ProgramData\\BistroMath\f1\fs20 ). Storing configurations with free choice of name is locked and must be unlocked with \f2 <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<R>\f1 .
\par With wedged fields or likewise asymmetric fields should be verified that both direction and signs conform with the used water phantom software. Especially the GT/Inline/Inplane direction is inconsistent defined amongst different vendors and sometimes even different versions of one vendor.
\par 
\par \cf3\{bmc options_off.gif\}
\par \cf0\lang2057\f0 
\par \lang1043\b\f1 Advanced Mode\b0 
\par To assure a uncomplicated standard mode almost all settings and menu's are locked and can be unlocked by checking \i Advanced Mode\i0 . However, loading presets can and will set all items regardless the state of \i Advanced Mode\i0 . The \i Advanced Mode\i0  state itself is not configurable. When advanced mode is preferred at startup this should be set in the \cf2\strike Advanced Settings tab\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=advanced_startup\}\cf0  and stored in a configuration file.
\par On returning to standard mode the last known configuration and preset will be restored from disk, ignoring the stored \i Advanced Mode\i0  preference.
\par Note that storing a configuration file with any other name than \f2 bistromath.ini\f1  is also blocked in standard mode. Therefore you need \i Advanced Mode\i0  to write \f2 institute.ini\f1 .
\par 
\par \b Simple Mode\b0 
\par The \cf2\strike Simple Mode\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=simple_mode\}\cf0  option hides a lot of features which should be carefully considered during configuration. Verify that this mode is unchecked ("\i off\i0 ").
\par 
\par \cf3\{bmc optionsmenu.gif\}\cf0 
\par 
\par \b Configuration files\cf3\{target=configuration_files\}\cf0\b0 
\par Bistromath does not depend on the Windows registry, but saves it own data in configuration files of the \i .ini\i0  type. In version 4 a lot of names were changed. To keep backward compatibility a conversionlist is used to convert any old elements (\f2 BM700_renamed_elements.ini\f1 ). This file can be removed if there are no ini-files written with previous versions.
\par 
\par \b Institute.ini\b0 
\par When found this file will be taken as only file for all settings. This is intended as \cf2\strike reliable standard configuation\cf3\strike0\{linkID=14\}\cf0  for all users in one institute.\lang2057\f0 
\par \lang1043\f1 
\par 
\par \b BistroMath.ini\b0 
\par When \f2 institute.ini\f1  is not found, \f2 bistromath.ini\f1  will be used. Also this file holds the full set of settings for the program. The difference is that this file has no protection and can be saved or loaded by any user.
\par 
\par \b Presets\b0 
\par \cf3\{bmc presetsmenu.gif\}\cf0 
\par Preset files contain a limited range of settings, mainly the menu options that can be checked/unchecked. There are a lot of meaningful combinations however that can be related to some "task". As tasks can change, another preset can be loaded. When a preset is loaded as command line parameter, the name is the file name without exclamation and extension (the file name \f2 compare!.ini\f1  would give "-preset compare"). 
\par 
\par \cf3\{target=overloading\}\cf0\b Configuration file overloading\b0 
\par For all \i configuration\i0  and \i presets\i0  files only the parameters found in the file are subject to any changes. All other settings remain unchanged. This implies that after starting BistroMath with a standard setup like \f2 institute.ini\f1 , any stripped down configuration can be loaded on top of the basic setup.
\par 
\par 
\par \b Ini-files\b0 
\par \cf3\{bmc configtab.gif\}\cf0 
\par The most essential configuration data for daily use such as reference depth and normalisation values ar found in the \cf2\strike Configuration tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=240\}\cf0 .
\par The reference depth is used to \cf2\strike normalise depth dose scans\cf3\strike0\{linkID=8\}. \cf0 Thus all displayed analysis values are based on this normalisation  ("\f3 AbsDepth/AbsValue\f1 "). The graphical display of the depth dose curve has its own normalisation ("\f3 RelDepth/RelValue\f1 "). When combined with a reference file the calculated division will be normalised at the same depth. Although the shape of the division will not change drastically the found minimum and maximum will be different. When using generic beams or reference dosimetry at a specific depth this might be the optimal setup.
\par When the dosimetrical system is based on a depth beyond dose maximum, all depth dose curves should be evaluated relative to this reference point. The text "PDD" is then changed to "RDD".
\par The Configuration tab is read-only when not in \cf2\strike Advanced Mode\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=advanced_mode\}\cf0 .
\par \lang2057\f0 
\par \lang1043\f1 These values are joined with \cf2\strike Dose Conversion parameters\cf3\strike0\{linkID=40\}.\cf0  Because there can be different film types this may lead to multiple dose depth definitions for one energy. Starting with version 2.00 all definitions for one energy are kept uniform.

\par \pard\cf3\{bmc results1.gif\}
\par 
\par \cf0\b Definitions for flatness and symmetry
\par \b0 The \b Absolute flatness\b0  is defined as \f2\fs24 maximum-minimum\f0\fs20 , i.e. the vertical range, denoted by the two \cf4 red lines\cf0  below. This value is presented for a filtered measurement and limited to the \b In-Field area\b0 , indicated by the \cf1 vertical blue lines\cf0  below. The In-Field area concept is based on conventional profiles. The same range however is still useful for non-flat profiles and then should be seen as \b\i analysis area\b0\i0 . When a division of two curves is evaluated, the \cf1\i relative flatness\cf0\i0  as calculated from the \cf1 blue "calculated" curve\cf0 .
\par For \cf2\strike FFF profiles\cf3\strike0\{linkID=149\}\cf0  the the flatness is meaningless. When a such a profile is detected the flatness is annotated with (F) and expressed in percent per cm. When both absolute and relative flatness are given for a FFF-curve, the absolute flatness is followed by a "c" and must be read as "%/cm".
\par The \b symmetry\b0  is defined as the largest ratio \f2\fs24 maximum\fs20 [centre-x]\fs24 -minimum\fs20 [center+x]\f0  for a point and its mirrored position within the In-Field area as calculated on a filtered curve found at the \cf4 red arrows\cf0  below.
\par These definitions are based on the Dutch NCS protocol and comply with most international protocols.
\par 
\par 
\par \b Example\b0 
\par \cf3\{bmc flatness.gif\}\cf0 
\par The flattness is 2.0%, found as \cf1 maximum\cf0  and \cf1 minimum\cf0  within the In-Field area. The symmetry value is found as ratio of the points at the \cf1 blue arrows\cf0 , giving 100.9%.
\par 
\par \b Elevation\b0 
\par When all measurement points within the In-Field area are fed into a linear (first degree) model, the slope is a good measure for the symmetry as shown in the example above. The slope is recalculated to a normalised height difference over the In-Field area: \f2\fs24 100\'b7slope\'b7(In-Field area width) \b /\b0  (normalisation value)\f0\fs20 . In the example above this is represented by the \cf4 red arrow\cf0 .
\par 
\par 
\par \b Area Ratio\b0 
\par \cf3\{bmc arearatio.gif\}
\par \cf0 The area ratio is defined as \f2\fs24 2\'b7(right half In-Field area - left half In-Field area) \b /\b0  (total In-Field area)\f0\fs20 . This alternative measure for the symmetry is insensitive to noise, has signed result value and gives a clinically more relevant figure. There is a caveat however with the definition given here when the field is asymmetrical with respect to the field center. A asymmetrical range will then produce large effects with a perfectly flat field. Also a asymmetric distribution of the data points can have significant effects for small fields. Therefore a resampled, symmetrical range (with the length of the In-Field area) is taken around the \i choosen\i0  field center. The center of field might be the origin, the middle of the field borders or the top of a FFF field. In the example above the actual calculation is 2*(B - A) / (A + B). Since the center is significantly different from the origin, the area ratio value is annotated with a 'b'.
\par 
\par 
\par \b Linac symmetry error
\par \cf3\b0\{bmc elekta_servo_plates_a.gif\}\cf0 
\par The internal ionization chamber of a linac compares the signal of two symmetric regions to evaluate the symmetry of the beam. For an Elekta machine segments of a ring shaped area with a inner radius of 7.3 cm (at isoc) and an outer diameter of about 15.3 cm, indicated with the \cf2 green boxes\cf0  below. By definition, the signal is averaged within each box ("\cf2\b L\cf0\b0 " and "\cf2\b R\cf0\b0 "). The \b Linac symmetry error\b0  is now \cf2\strike calculated\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=linacerror\}\cf0  as 2*(\cf2\b L\cf0\b0 -\cf2\b R\cf0\b0 )/(\cf2\b L\cf0\b0 +\cf2\b R\cf0\b0 ). For the calculation in BistroMath the evaluation is also limited by the field borders (the 50% positions or derivative based). Thus for smaller fields the Linac symmetry error possibly is not calculated at all. The boxes are corrected for actual SSD and measurement depth. It is displayed when the \i Linac symmetry error\i0  is selected in the \cf2\strike Measurement menu\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0 . The inner and outer radius can be set in the \cf2\strike Settings tab\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=linacsymsettings\}\cf0 .\lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\f0 
\par 
\par \b Relative flatness\b0 
\par \cf3\{bmc relative_flatness.gif\}
\par \cf0 When there is a reference available, a division of measurement and reference can be calculated. The relative flatness is found as \cf1 maximum\cf0  and \cf1 minimum\cf0  within the In-Field area for this line.

\par \pard\b\fs24 Reliable results\b0\fs20 
\par BistroMath is highly adaptable and configurable to users needs. This might also be a pitfall when multiple users are using the same software for a common basic task.
\par This can be managed with several strategies:
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 saving all \cf2\strike preferences\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0  in the predefined, "protected", \f1 institute.ini\f0  or any other user-defined configuration file when used with \cf2\strike command-line parameters\cf3\strike0\{linkID=16\}\cf0 ,
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}using \cf2\strike presets\cf3\strike0\{linkID=180\}\cf0  to set for specific tasks, optionally loaded at start with \cf2\strike command line parameters\cf3\strike0\{linkID=16\}\cf0 ,

\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}blocking most settings at startup in \cf2\strike standard mode\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=advanced_mode\}\cf0 .
\par \pard 
\par \b\fs24 Configurable output to screen and file\b0\fs20 
\par All visible analysis results can \cf2\strike be configured\cf3\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  from \cf2\strike this list\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=evaluation_types\}\cf0  In the \cf2\i\strike special modes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0\i0  additional output can be written to a file and/or the clipboard.
\par Also less used features can be \cf2\strike hidden for the user\cf3\strike0\{linkID=140\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \b\fs24 Multiple data input routes for multiple files\b0\fs20 
\par A key concept of BistroMath is the observation of the Windows clipboard for plain text data. This clipboard interception can be switched off/on. Data less or equal to the \cf2\strike configurable value\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ini_only\}\cf0  \i MinClipBoardBytes\i0  or starting with "BistroMath" are ignored. When recognised as valid data they will be used. Also files can be dropped or opened in the classical way. Multiple files can be dropped or opened when the \cf2\strike history list\cf3\strike0\{linkID=90\}\cf0  is activated.
\par 
\par \b\fs24 Multiple data formats\b0\fs20 
\par A \cf2\strike lot of data formats\cf3\strike0\{linkID=900\}\cf0  of all major water phantom suppliers, including some binary formats, are supported.
\par 
\par \b\fs24 Data correction\b0\fs20 
\par Probably not much used, but data can be converted to dose with user defined parameters and/or corrected for background. These parameters are \cf2\strike related to different file types\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0 . 
\par \i 
\par \b\i0\fs24 Depth dose analysis\b0\fs20 
\par The correct normalisation position is set according to the \cf2\strike user settings\cf3\strike0\{linkID=80\}\cf0 . Note that fixed depths might be used here. Dependent on these settings "PDD" values might be presented as "RDD"values. Next (p|r)DD\fs16 10\fs20  and (p|r)DD\fs16 20\fs20  positions are calculated. On top of the objective depth dose at certain levels the graphical normalisation point is relevant when the measurement is compared with a reference. Especially for generic beams the depth of standard dosimetry should be taken for normalisation. Now dose differences in the measurement compared to the reference depth curve will be zero at the (grapical) reference depth in stead of dose maximum. The maximum is fitted with a quadratic fit to evaluate the position and height of the maximum. The same code is used for standard filtering with identical settings.
\par 
\par \cf1\b\fs24 Relative curves\cf0\b0\fs20 
\par \cf3\lang2057\{bmc selftest_027.gif\}
\par \cf0\lang1043 
\par A key concept of BistoMath is the comparison of a measurement with its reference curve. Please read the \cf2\strike overview\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2\}\cf0 . Reference curves are \cf2\strike stored by the user\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=save_reference\}\cf0  and \cf2\strike as default\cf3\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0  loaded automatically, based on machine name, modality, energy, wedge status, field size and depth. The machine name of the reference can be overruled at load time by using a \cf2\strike alias\cf3\strike0\{linkID=20\}\cf0 . \cf2\strike Temporary references\cf3\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0  can be used also.
\par In the image above a \cf4 measurement\cf0  is \cf1 divided\cf0  with a symmetry corrected \cf2 reference\cf0  profile after profile alignment based on matching because of missing penumbras. Both aligment and symmetry correction are noted in the \cf2 reference information text\cf0 . For the same reason all results based on the field borders are \cf4 red\cf0 . The flatness of the measurement itself is 2.0% but when compared to the reference the range of differences, the relatve flatness, is limited to 1.2%.
\par \i 
\par Profile alignment\i0 
\par When a reference is loaded, the center of the reference is \cf2\strike optionally\cf3\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0  moved towards the center of the measurement. This can be problematic when a field border is missing in measurement and/or reference. Then fallback strategies are used, based on the first derivative or \cf2\strike matching\cf3\strike0\{linkID=139\}\cf0  as last resort.
\par 
\par \i Symmetry correction\i0 
\par Also, the reference profile might be slightly asymmetrical, which \cf2\strike optionally\cf3\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0  can be corrected. The slope of a straight line, fitted on the data with the In-Field area is applied to the data, starting at the field center.
\par 
\par \i Comparison\i0 
\par The result of the comparison with a reference curve, the \cf1 calculated curve\cf0 , is \cf2\strike user defined\cf3\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0 . The primary design target was to calculate the difference as \f2 measured/reference\f0 , normalised to 100% in the normalisation point. In that case the flatness of the \cf1 calculated curve\cf0  also can be evaluated: the relative flatness.
\par Alternatively a \cf2\strike gamma calculation\cf3\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  can be applied.
\par The reference may also be used to combine it with the reference to \cf2\strike one summed curve\cf3\strike0\{linkID=137\}\cf0 . This can simulate the effect of abutted fields.
\par 
\par \cf3\{target=concepts_division\}\cf0\i Division of measurement and reference\i0 
\par When the comparison is chosen to be the division of measurement and reference the calculation starts with the raw data of both measurement and reference. After quadratic filtering to temporary buffers the center of both profiles is calculated. Then the divison is calculated on points with the same relative position to the center in their data set. The result curve is passed through a median filter.
\par 
\par \i Field types\i0 
\par Profiles are classified as \i Standard\i0 , \i FFF\i0 , \i Wedge\i0  or \i Small\i0 . This concept is further explained on the \cf2\strike Field types page\cf3\strike0\{linkID=23\}\cf0 . All related parameers can be found on the \cf2\strike Field Types tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=130\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \b\fs24 Multiple-data files\b0\fs20 
\par Files with several measurements in one single file come in two variants:
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 A series of profiles with no predefined ordening. These are mostly data sets from water phantom like the IBA \cf2\strike RFA300 format (*.asc)\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=RFA300\}\cf0 , \cf2\strike OmniPro 6 binary (*.rbf)\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=OmniPro_rfb\}\cf0 , \cf2\strike PTW (*.mcc)\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=mcc_ascii\}\cf0 . Any profile in such a set is treated as individual profile.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}A fixed, organised data set, mostly from a specific detector like a \cf2\strike 2D array\cf3\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0 . The data can be used as indivdual profiles, but the set as such can be stored as reference in the original format. This makes it possible to automatically \cf2\strike extract the appropriate curve\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=DeviceSpecificReference\}\cf0  as reference. 
\par \pard For multiple-data files the \cf2\strike\f3 <PageUP>/<PageDown>\cf3\strike0\f0\{linkID=19\}\cf0  keys are used to browse through the file.
\par 
\par \b\fs24 Temporary references\b0\fs20 
\par Any scan can be used as \cf2\strike temporary reference\cf3\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0 , which can be handy to compare two variants of beam settings/machines/fields. Also a check on the scan type can be switched off. When a temporary reference is active, no other reference will be loaded automatically.

\par Zooming of the vertical scale can be done with the \f2 <Up>\f0  and \f2 <Down>\f0  keys. The keys \f2 <Z>\f0  and \f2 <U>\f0  set or unset zoomed state. Graphical zooming can be done with the mouse left button pressed selecting an area from top-left to bottom-right. The other way around for unzoom.
\par 
\par \i Graphical elements\i0 
\par Besides the obvious data curves there are helper lines (Top model, FFF slopes, penumbras, residual error dots), indicators (In-Field Area) and cursors. All of these elements can be toggled on/off in the \cf2\strike View menu\cf3\strike0\{linkID=110\}\cf0  or simple keyboard shortcuts. See also curve selection below.
\par 
\par \i Curve selection\i0 
\par Data curves can be selected by clicking on corresponding label. Pressing the <\f2 spacebar\f0 > cycles through all available elements and brings these to the foreground.
\par With the curly brackets '\i\{\i0 ' and ''\i\}\i0 ', data points on these lines can be made smaller and larger respectively. The round brackets, '(' and ')', do the same but are reserved for uniquely for the \i measured\i0  curve. See \cf2\strike keyboard functions\cf3\strike0\{linkID=19\}\cf0  for more details.

\par \cf4\f0 "Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behavior of numbers. Just as Albert Einstein's general relativity theory observed that space was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in time, and that time was not an absolute, but dependent on the observer's movement in space, so it is now realised that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants."
\par \tab\cf0 Douglas Adams; \i Life, the Universe and Everything\i0 , 1982 
\par 
\par 
\par Further explanation of the theory behind bistromathics:
\par 
\par \cf4 "The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or the number of people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has shown up.
\par 
\par The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of mathematics, including statistics and accountancy, and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field.
\par 
\par The third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table and what they are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this field.)"\cf0 
\par 
\par The Bistromath was a ship used by Slartibartfast to save the world from the people of Krikkit. It used the Bistromathic Drive to get through the universe. The inside of the ship looks exactly the same as that of the inside of a italian restaurant and the ships trajectory can be modified by ordering different things on the menu.

\par \pard\lang1043\f1 Starting with version 3.20 all results in this panel are completely configurable. The explanation below assumes a \cf2\strike standard setup\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=standard_panel_setup\}\cf0 .
\par The \cf2\strike v3.20 rule set\cf3\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  has been carefully designed to reflect previous versions. All \i values\i0  are clickable: the result will be copied to the clipboard.
\par 
\par The results of the analysis are shown below the graph and depend on the type of profile:
\par 
\par \i Inline/crossline profiles\i0 
\par \cf3\{bmc results1.gif\}\cf0 
\par The left and right positions values are presented for a filtered curve according to the chosen definition (50%, \cf2\strike user set value\cf3\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0 , derivative edge detection or sigmoid model). The exception here is the sigmoid model; because of its statistical nature it is based on the unfiltered measurement. For this purpose the main axis is chosen as reference point \i if the main axis falls within the measuring range and the dose value is at least 95% of the maximum dose\i0 . Otherwise first the left and right position are based on the dose maximum and the new normalisation point is chosen as the average of these preliminary positions. This \cf2\strike normalisation point\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=normalisation\}\cf0  can also be set.
\par The \cf2\strike flatness\cf3\strike0\{linkID=5\}\cf0  is calculated as defined by NCS-8 within the central 80% of the 50% width. Also the maximum value within this area is given. \cf4 When a reference file is used to calculate a relative error \i and\i0  the \cf1 calculated\cf4  curve is set to visible, also the \i relative flatness\i0  is given\cf5 .\cf0  Alternatively, a \cf2\strike Gamma analysis\cf3\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  can be calculated. Then the \i Confidence Limit\i0  is given as \i m\i0 +1.5\bullet\i s\i0  of the gamma curve (where \i m\i0  and \i s\i0  are the estimated mean and standard deviation).
\par \cf3 
\par \{bmc fff_results.gif\}\cf0 
\par When the origin is chosen as \cf2\strike Center of Field\cf3\strike0\{linkID=128\}\cf0  \i and\i0  for FFF profiles the In-Field field CoF strategy is taken as default strategy, not the center will be reported but the position of the top. There are two different models available: the Top model and the Slopes model. Also, the penumbra values are replaced with the slope values (in %/cm) as found with the \cf2\strike sigmoid model\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0 . Note that the slope is much more sensitive to the quality of the fit and the \cf2\strike chosen fit range\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=edgedetectionlimit\}\cf0 .

\par \cf2 Green values and labels\cf0 : the curve shifted. The \cf2\strike measurement may be shifted towards the center\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0  by the user. As standard behavior the \cf2\strike reference curve is aligned\cf3\strike0\{linkID=134\}\cf0  with the measurement. The needed shift for the reference profile is reported in the curve title.
\par \cf1 Blue values\cf0 : non-standard results on corrected curves (i.e. symmetry correction on measurement curve).

\par 
\par \pard\tx200\lang1043\f0 Using different file types and/or different tank setups might lead to a mixup of directions when comparing data and would lead to significant larger complexity of the code. Therefore, starting with version 2.20, the data point reading code for all file types was reviewed and partly rewritten in such a way that the data are stored internally always as G\'bbT / A\'bbB / U\'bbD / L\'bbR. As the interpretation of the data itself is not changed, this review should have no effect for any previously generated data file. However newly written data files represent the internal storage conventions as decribed above.
\par This reduced complexity has a small disadvantage. As data are not always presented anymore in the direction as measured, this might lead to an inverted bottom axis when compared side-by-side with the measuring system and can be corrected with \cf2\strike Axis swapping\cf3\strike0\{linkID=13\}\cf0 .
\par Note that data are really inverted, when  \cf2\strike Axis swapping\cf3\strike0\{linkID=13\}\cf0  is used and rewritten to some file. The original data can always be saved from the \cf2\strike editor window\cf3\strike0\{linkID=3\}\cf0 . When data are \cf2\strike stored as reference\cf3\strike0\{linkID=50\}\cf0 , always the editor data are used.

\par For most users it is prefered that the graph view matches with the profiles as seen in the water phantom software. Notably the GT-axis is handled inconsitent by different vendors or even different versions of one vendor. Therefore here the GT (inline/inplane) axis is taken as example. The axis designations and/or the axis direction (sign) might be wrong. Therefore both can be altered independentty.
\par BistroMath is carefully designed to preserve the original data on export. Therefore axis swapping normally will not effect the export at all.

\par This option in the Measurement menu regulates the effects of axis swapping on export. Its default state is \i on\i0 .

\par \cf0 A histogram is a statistical analysis tool in which all data values are sorted into discrete ranges which are called \i bins\i0 .

\par \pard\lang1043\f1 Starting with version 3.20 all results in the \cf2\strike Results panel\cf3\strike0\{linkID=11\}\cf0  are completely configurable. This page explains the mechanism and how to set up your own rules.
\par 
\par \b Default rule setup\b0 
\par \pard\tx200 All panel rules must be introduced through a configuration or preset file. If no rules are given BistroMath will take its own default. 
\par \pard In version 3.20 it designed to reflect the previous version as closely as possible.
\par \pard\tx200 
\par \pard\b Startup logics\b0 
\par At startup the Results panel is empty. No analysis results will be displayed in this state.
\par However, also loading a configuration file is part of the startup. After this step all standard 'rules' (explained below) will be added if \cf2\strike Standard Panel setup\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=standard_panel_setup\}\cf0  is activated or no external rules are loaded. Therefore, after setup the panel rules list might contain a mixture of own rules and standard rules. All rules in the list by design have unique identification numbers (\i id\i0 's). At startup, and also by pressing \f2 <End>\f1 , a mapping of each rule \i id\i0  per location is displayed.
\par \cf3\{bmc emptypanel.gif\}
\par \cf0 
\par \b Panel rules list\cf3\{target=panel_rules_list\}\cf0\b0 
\par The \i Panel rules list\i0  drives the display of analysis results in the \i Results panel\i0 . Currently there are two colums of eight rows available.
\par After analysis the complete list will be evualated. When a rule is found to be applicable (for instance scantype and modality) the configured result parameter will be displayed at the also configured panel position. Multiple rules can exist for the same position. Effectively the last applicable rule for each position will be visible.
\par 
\par \b Ordering of the list\b0 
\par New rules are always appended to the bottom of the list. When there exists another rule with the same \i id\i0  this rule will be removed.
\par 
\par \b Rules list in Simple Mode\b0 
\par In \cf2\strike Simple Mode\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=simple_mode\}\cf0  only a limited range of features is shown. This behavior can also be applied to the result panel. In the default setup this is not configured however. The condition "s" will introduce this for any rule. Make a copy of the rule and add "\f3 ,cond:s\f1 " to any rule. When, for example, only the Normalisation is to be hidden in Simple Mode, only this changed rule needs to be in the configuration file:
\par 
\par \lang0\f3\tab [PanelElements]
\par \tab ;when add-mode is off, at startup no default rules will be added.
\par \tab ;with add-mode on, default rules will be added except for rules with the same ID.\cf4 
\par \tab add=\cf0 1

\par \lang1043\f1 
\par Because a rule with a existing \i id\i0  is re\'efntroduced, this will override the existing rule.
\par 
\par \cf1\b Setting up rules and avalailable evaluation types\cf0 
\par 
\par Getting the current setup\b0 
\par A good starting point for making new rules is the standard available rule set. This can be acquired by saving either a configuration or a preset.

\par \cf3\{bmc emptypanel.gif\}
\par 
\par \cf0\b Rule list format\b0 
\par \pard\tx200 Each rule consists of a series of values separated by a delimiter. The default delimiter is a comma ("\b\fs24 ,\b0\fs20 "). This may be changed at any time and will be used for all following rules.
\par 
\par \i ;changing the delimiter
\par \cf1\i0 sep=,\cf0 
\par 
\par \i ;adding to existing rules (1), start from scratch (0) or clear all existing rules (-1)\i0 
\par \cf1 add=1\cf0 
\par 
\par Therefore the general format is:
\par \pard\cf1\f4 
\par unique_ident_string=item\{delimiter\}item[\{delimiter\}item]
\par \pard\tx200\cf0\f1 
\par As ident for each rule is the \i id\i0 -number taken, but it can be any text except "sep", "add" and "doc".
\par The current setup of a rule is given by the "doc" string.
\par \pard\cf1\f4 doc=v\{\i build\i0\},id,curve sel,eval.type,multiplier,errorval,"label",deci,unit,col,row,mod,energy,scan type[,cond:-][,annot:-][,color:-]
\par 
\par b\{\i build\i0\}
\par \cf0\f1 The build number is not checked at this moment, but might be used in future. A legal integer value must be given. The "b" is just for readability.
\par 
\par \cf1\f4 id
\par \cf0\f1 The identification number is a positive integer. When a rule with the same \i id\i0  is found in the list, that rule will be removed. A line having a negative \i id\i0  will remove all rules for that number. In this case the remaining part of the line may be omitted.
\par \cf1\f4 
\par curve selector
\par \cf0\f1 The curve selector is an integer value. It decides which curve is used as source for the data. 
\par With a value of \cf5 -1\cf0  the appropriate default is taken.
\par Other legal values are 0=dsMeasured, 1=dsMeasFiltered, 2=dsCalculated, 3=dsReference, 4=dsBuffer, 5=dsRefOrg, 6=dsUnrelated.
\par 
\par \cf3\f4\{target=evaluation_types\}\cf1 evaluation type
\par \cf0\f1 The currently supported evaluation data types are listed below. These are used in both \cf2\strike Results panel rules\cf3\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  and \cf2\strike special modes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0 .

\par 
\par \cf1\f4 energy selector
\par \cf0\f1 When the value is set to 0 any energy is accepted.
\par Any other value will be used to compare with the actual energy. Because comparing floating points may be 'risky' due to type conversions there always needs to be an uncertainty range. This is set to 0.01 MeV. Therefore the energy is converted to 'energy steps' as round(energy/uncertainty) to make the comparison fast and robust. Now it is also easy to introduce a simple range by allowing "<" or ">" as preceding character.

There is only a limited number of fixed, predefined colors. Only the application of these colors is regulated here.

\par \cf1\f4 size:
\par \cf0\f1 The size rule is way to set a limit on the fiels size. For Depth dose scans the set (given) field size in cm is used, when available with a default of 0. For profiles the measured field size in the scan direction, normalised to the default SSD, is taken. A lower limit and an upper limit can be set. A valid limit is any value preceded by "<" or ">".

\par 
\par \cf0\b Introduction\b0 
\par The penumbra region can with good approximation be modelled with a sigmoid function. The general description, also known as Richard's function, can be found in \cf1\strike Wikipedia\cf3\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function")\}\cf0  and \cf1\strike MyAssays\cf3\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("https://www.myassays.com/four-parameter-logistic-regression.html")\}\cf0 .Here a reduced four parameter version is used:
\par \cf3\{bmc 4PL-function.gif\}
\par \cf0 where:
\par \tab A: the low level of the function
\par \tab B: the approximate inflection point
\par \tab C: the slope of the sigmoid
\par \tab D: the high level
\par 
\par The real inflection point can be found as:
\par \cf3\{bmc 4PL-inflection_point.gif\}
\par \cf0 The inflection point correction is very small as the slope has typically a value in the order of 100.
\par The function does not perform well for x=0. Therfore the data are shifted if needed to guarantee that the whole range to fit does not include the origin. As the inflection point is closely related to the \cf2\strike peak in the first derivative of the data\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0  this is an excellent initial value of B. Around this point a range of typically 2 cm is chosen. The first and last data point can used to low level (A), high level (D) and slope (C) as initial values for a fitting procedure. Such a procedure needs only a few loops to converge.
\par The inverse function can be used to calculate the position of other levels around then inflection point:
\par \cf3\{bmc 4PL-inverse_function.gif\}\cf0 
\par 
\par \b Finding the function parameters\b0 
\par The function parameters can easily be accurately initialised. As the inflection point is closely related to the peak in the first derivative of the data this is an excellent initial value of B. Around this point a range of typically 2 cm is chosen. The first and last data point can used to estimate the low level (A), high level (D) and slope (C). Then a \cf2\strike Nelder-Mead\cf3\strike0\{linkID=400\}\cf0  procedure is started with the overal difference between data and function as penalty to optimise all parameters with very few cycles.

\par \pard\cf0\lang1043\b\fs24 Introduction\b0\fs20 
\par In the classic radiotherapy the field border is defined as the full width half maximum (FWHM). Each part of this concept has its problems, even for standard flattened beams:
\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 The maximum might be on a position far outside the field center (for instance wedged beams).
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The field center might not coincide with the origin of the measurement system.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The assumption that the FWHM gives the best connection with adjacent fields may be wrong.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The field border clearly is not the FWHM for wegded beams and FFF profiles.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Methods may become problematic with sparse data points like 2D-array data sets.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Simple interpolation between two points is unreliable to find a border level.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}There is also noise to deal with.
\par \pard\tx200 
\par \pard\b\fs24 Profile analysis\cf3\{target=profile_analysis\}\cf0\b0\fs20 
\par The strategy of profile analysis in BistroMath has an elaborate design to get it as stable as possible. Flaws in the data which might lead to illegal mathematical operations are dealt with in the code by exception handlers. The data might be the raw data or a filtered version. When the data are a derivative or a division only relevant parameters are evaluated. The tasks related to analysis of a single profile can be divided into field border detection, center of field detectection, normalisation level calculation and final \cf2\strike analysis results\cf3\strike0\{linkID=5\}\cf0  based on the \cf2\strike In-Field area\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=flattenedarea\}\cf0  and penumbra region.
\par If the user has chosen to move the center of the profile to the origin (see \cf2\strike Move profile to origin\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0 ), this is done first. The preliminary status of the 50% positions has a neglegible effect. Related curves (Calculated, Reference, Buffer) are moved over the same distance.
\par A lot of options can be applied to the \cf2\strike measurement data\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \i Preliminary analysis\i0 
\par In the first stage the data are scanned to find the maximum and minimum value. Further actions depend on a correct registration of the data (profile or depth dose curve).
\par The maximum is used as a base for determination of 50% and 90% dose level positions. When these positions are highly asymmetrical it is concluded that the data describe a wedged profile. See \cf2\strike wedged profiles\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=wedged_profiles_strategy\}\cf0  below. The centre of the field is defined as the average of the 50% positions.
\par \i 
\par Field border detection\i0 
\par BistroMath detects the border at several levels: 20%, 50%, 80%, 90%, \i high\i0 , \i low\i0 , \i edge, sigmoid inflection\i0 , \i sigmoid model based level\i0  and \cf2\i\strike user dose level\cf3\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0\i0 . For each level and side the position is stored when succesful or noted as failure otherwise. The edge detection is based on the \cf2\strike first derivative and statistical analysis\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=edge_detection_theory\}\cf0  and can be used as \cf2\strike fallback\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0  when the 50% level detection fails or \cf2\strike differs too much\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=edgedetectionlimit\}\cf0  from the 50% position (\cf2\strike user dose level\cf3\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0  may be used alternatively as "50%"). The \i high\i0  and \i low\i0  dose position are also \cf2\strike user defined\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0  to comply with any protocol and used for the penumbra width calculation.
\par Ultimately any border detection depends on the defined "100%" level an can be used with different reference levels. In first instance the reference level is chosen at maximum of the profile. The provisional borders are used to define the center of field which \i can\i0  be used to define the normalisation level. Dependent on \cf2\strike user settings\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=normalisation\}\cf0  the final normalisation is used to calculate all borders again.
\par To avoid misdetection all levels above 65% are searched inwards, all other positions outwards from the center of field. The final position is found by interpolation on a second order fit.
\par The fixed levels 20%..90% do have a \cf2\strike backdoor\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=borders_config\}\cf0  in the configuration file. 
\par More details can be found in \cf2\strike Edge detection\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \i Center of field\i0 
\par In standard software the center of field is limited to (the defined position of) the main axis. This works fine for standard symmetrical fields, but completely fails when the field does not cross the main axis as measured for jaw position calibration. Therefore a more general defintion is needed: the average of the two field borders at 50% or alternatively at a \cf2\strike user defined level\cf3\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0 .

\par To reduce the sensitivity for noise in the normalisation level calculation some averaging is done. This range is \cf2\strike configurable\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=normalisation\}\cf0 . See also the detailed discussion the \cf2\i\strike Center of Field and Normalisation\cf3\strike0\{linkID=128\}\cf0\i0  topic.

\par \i Final analysis: flatness, symmetry and linac error\i0 
\par The penumbra width is \cf2\strike user-defined\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0  as the distance between the \cf2\strike predefined levels\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0  \i high \i0 and \i low\i0 . The levels can be different for photon beams and electron beams. The definition is displayed as text with the penumbra values (for example: "L80-20").
\par Flatness and symmetry are defined in the In-Field area and calculated on the filtered curve. The In-Field area is defined here according to NCS as 80% of the 50%-width for the major axis and 70% of the 50%-width on the diagonals for fields larger than 10x10 cm and 1 cm for smaller fields. This is more complicated for fields smaller than 3 cm and fields with a missing penumbra. If there is no penumbra detected and this situation is acceptable by the user, the field limits are taken at a higher level which is guaranteed to be available at both the left and right side of the profile.See \cf2\strike flatness, symmetry Area Ratio, Elevation and Linac symmetry error\cf3\strike0\{linkID=5\}\cf0 .
\par \cf3\b\{target=wedged_profiles_strategy\}\cf0\b0\i Wedged profiles\i0 
\par For wedged profiles the field borders (normally defined as the 50% level positions) are presented as the position of the two peaks in the derivative. In this case the figures will be displayed in a deviant color. The derivative is displayed in the \cf2\strike buffer curve\cf3\strike0\{linkID=110\}\cf0 . The peak values are calculated by interpolation with a second order fit. \cf3\{target=FFFcalculations\}
\par \cf0\i FFF profiles\i0 
\par \cf2\strike FFF-beams\cf3\strike0\{linkID=149\}\cf0  are detected and presented with alternative analysis results. The average of the (absolute) slope is presented in percent per cm. The symmetry is the normalised summed (positive and negative) slope multiplied by the width of the full analysis range ("In-Field area").\cf1\lang2057\b\fs32

\par The most 2D-arrays store the data as a \cf3\strike multiple profile dataset\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=\lang1043 multiple_profiles\lang1033\}\cf0 . These files can be stored to disk with the measuring software. After this the files can be opened in BistroMath where they can be compared with reference files. The individual profiles can be stored for any direction as reference. Alternatively a complete dataset may be stored as reference or compared to an already available reference. This behavior is switched on with the \cf3\i\strike Device specific Reference\cf2\i0\strike0\{linkTarget=DeviceSpecificReference\}\cf0  option in \i Reference menu\i0 . This option is only available for supported 2D-arrays and ignored otherwise. In that case the menu item will be disabled (grayed out). At this moment only the PTW \i StarCheck Maxi\i0   and Sun Nuclear \i IC Profiler\i0  are implemented. The list of supported arrays is maintained in \f2\fs16 [WellhoferObject]\f0\fs20  section of the \cf3\strike configuration file(s)\cf2\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 . The \cf3\strike data format for the PTW 2D-array\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=mcc_ascii\}\cf0  does not follow the conventions set out in the PTW documentation. For PTW there are limitations. The applications BeamAdjust and MultiCheck do write a different ordering for the profiles and cannot be mixed unless \cf3\strike reference indexing\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=referenceIndexing\}\cf0  is switched \i on\i0 . Other arrays can be added if there is any interest.
\par The Sun Nuclear \i Profiler\i0  software export format can be written to either file or clipboard. In the latter case a full coupling with BistroMath is established.

\par \cf0 In this example a measurement generated by PTW MultiCheck is opened. This file starts with some data setes that do \i not\i0  qualify as scan. Therefore the first aceptable scan (5/20), being a crossline scan, is taken. As this is a registered 2D-array the standard multiple reference will be taken. Normally also the fifth scan in this reference would be opened as they are assumed to be well-structured. That scan is a point measurement and does not qualify as scan. BistroMath will cycle through the file to find the first legal scan. This happens to be the inline scan and no comparison will made. However, here the index takes over and loads the correct scan. The result of the comparison in this specific still is unusable as in the measurement the BQ-CHECK Test Object is placed on the StarCheck. It demonstrates clearly the flexibility of the indexing however. Indexing large files might take considerable time however. When multiple scans qualify, the first one will be taken.\lang2057\f1

\par Concepts\b0 
\par In old versions of BistroMath the editor window was reread and processed when preferences or menu options were changed. This could also be enforced by the \i File\i0  menu option\cf2\i\strike  Load current data\cf3\strike0\{linkID=50\}\cf0\i0 . For binary files with a single curve the data were converted to a text format and put in the editor for convenience and reload of the current data. For multiple curve binary formats like the \cf2\strike rfb format\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=OmniPro_rfb\}\cf0  this is not implemented. The Nelder-Mead PDD-fit introduced also the need for a reprocessing feature. This is covered in this menu. Also the \cf2\i\strike Use as Temporary reference\cf3\strike0\{linkID=71\}\cf0\i0  option is moved from the \i File\i0  menu to this menu.
\par 
\par \cf3\b\{target=autoscaling\}\cf0\b0\f1 
\par \b\f0 Autoscaling\b0 
\par This fundamental feature of BistroMath should normally be switched \i on\i0 . It renormalises data to (mostly) 100 at some point, both on the screen and before doing any comparison. There may be situations where an absolute data set is compared with another and no scaling is wanted. Note that with \cf2\strike measurement renormalisation\cf3\strike0\{linkID=112\}\cf0  a data set can be made absolute. These renormalised data also can be set as Temporary Reference.
\par \cf4 Note: Autoscaling is locked in its on state by default. Unlock it with \f2 <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<R>\f0 .\cf0

\par \pard\cf3\lang2057\{target=apply_sigmoid\}\cf0 
\par \b Apply sigmoid model on Buffer\b0 
\par Normally the buffer contains the derivative of a profile to show the results of the edge detection algorithm. The next level of edge detection is the inflection point of a \cf2\strike sigmoid fit\cf3\strike0\{linkID=22\}\cf0 . To show the performance of this strategy, all the used data points are replace with the sigmoid fit. Typically this will be visible in the shoulder area where the fit starts to deviate from the data. The penumbra itself should closely follow the data. Note that the inflection point still might become less reliable when applied on conventional profiles where the penumbra becomes an almost straight line.
\par 
\par \b Reprocess current data\b0 
\par This will restart all processing on the raw data as read from file or editor window. The PDD-fit will be started with the current parameters for the best fit.
\par 
\par \b Reset Nelder-Mead fit\b0 
\par A restart as above. The PDD-fit will be started with the initial default parameters.
\par 
\par \cf3\lang1043\b\{target=merging\}\cf0 Merge Source with measurement\b0 
\par This activates merging of two scans. See the item \cf2\strike Merging of scans\cf3\strike0\{linkID=72\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \lang2057\b Set Measurement as Merge source ("stitching")\b0 
\par This option sets the first part of the profile/depth dose to combined with (merged with, stichted to) a following scan.
\par 
\par \b Clear Merge source\b0 
\par This option frees the \i Unrelated\i0  curve which is used to store the merge source and thus making it available again for other tasks.
\par 
\par \cf3\lang1043\b\{target=mirroring\}\cf0 Mirrored measurement as Reference\lang1033\b0\f1 
\par \cf3\lang1043\f0\{bmc selfmirror.gif\}\cf0 
\par When checked, the current profile is copied to the background reference storage. Then this copied profile is mirrored around the Center of Field. Now the Temporary reference item is activated and the new reference loaded as any other temporary reference. The state of this item will not change until switched off again and will therefore work on any next profile. Taking any other temporary reference or clearing the temporary reference will also unset this option. See the \cf2\strike separate item\cf3\strike0\{linkID=73\}\cf0  for details.

\par \pard\b\f0 Partial scans\b0 
\par \lang1043 The circular water phantom of Sun Nuclear uses already this concept to create a larger scan area with one single detector. This guarantees accuracy of measurement positions and normalisation.
\par For the Elekta MR-Linac a water phantom with a dual scanning head is developed to provide a reasonable scan width. With a horizontal beam also two partial depth dose curves can be created. Due to the nature of a dual scanning head the distance between the two detectors might not be fully accurate. Also the normalisation can be different. 
\par The current implementation is based on the typical FFF-shape of the beam. Therefore a profile can be matched on the central part of the beam. A reasonable overlap is needed. A depth dose curve needs predefined information on the relative distance or consistent positional information in both scans. The merge procedure in principle offers both approaches. In future releases correct alignment might be set on base of the given field size.
\par 
\par When the field to be measured is larger than the water phantom, it can be measured as two partial scans. In the MR-linac, due to the bore, the scan width is a trade-off with the wanted water depth. Therefore a dual scanning head was designed. 
\par \cf3\{bmc merge_sources.gif\}
\par \cf0 A general example is given above where one single profile was split into two separate partial scans with some overlap. One of the two partial scans was also shifted and rescaled to 120%. To show both scans in one image, the right scan was loaded as temporary reference, while \i Align with Measurement\i0  in the Reference menu was switched off. Then the left scan was loaded as measurement. The difference in scaling is lost in this representation due to rescaling of BistroMath.
\par 
\par Now the Measurement (left scan) is copied to a background memory with the \i Set measurement as Merge Source\i0  option in the Processing menu. As a result this option will be shown as "Checked". Any next partial scan can be merged with the source using the \i Merge Source with measurement\i0  option. Note that both scans should have the same characteristics (treatment unit, energy, field size, depth). Failures are reported in the \cf2\strike Messages tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=300\}\cf0 .
\par \cf3\{bmc processingmenu.gif\}
\par 
\par \cf0\i Profiles\cf3\i0 
\par \cf0 When the next loaded curve has identical parameters (amongst others scan type, scan depth, field size, energy and linac), the first measurement is merged with the second. When the merge procedure is completed succesfully the \i Merge\i0  option in the Processing menu is unchecked. In the overlap area the first curve is (optionally) resampled to the second curve. All other points are simple added to the second curve. With the data as presented above, this needs both shifting and rescaling. The shift can be any combination of a manual shift and a matching procedure. To get this working BistroMath needs to handle partial scans with just one penumbra correctly.

\par This proces works also for depth dose curves but the two parts are never matched. The correct shift has to be provided in that case.

Here the \cf2\strike Mayneord\cf3\strike0\{linkID=77\}\cf0  transform is applied automatically. This rather strange method is needed in the MR-linac where the available vertical scan range is limited.
\par When the SSD's differ the lower part of the curve is added to the upper part. Therefore the header data of the upper part are conserved.

\par \lang1043 For both photon and elctron fields the fluence at the surface is ruled (with good approximation) by the inverse square law. Below the water surface the behavior splits in two branches. 
\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 All particles in a particle beam like electrons will loose energy over the whole path travelled from the surface into the water. This loss of energy is roughly constant and proportional with the elctron density of the material. Therefore the shape of a electron depth dose curve is almost independent of the source to surface distance (SSD).
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Photons is ruled by the probability of the first interaction with the material and is by first approximation ruled by an exponential decay function. But the number of photons with the first interaction at some depth is therefore also dependent on the inverse square law. Thus the shape of a photon depth dose curve is dependent on the SSD. After the first interaction released energy is redistributed by electrons. Because the electron paths are dominated by forward scattering, dose will be transferred somewhat further along the beam direction. Near the surface some electrons will escape, lowering the deposited dose significantly.

\par The depth dose curve (PDD) describes the dose as a function of depth (\i d\i0 ) and is dependent on the type of material, photon energy (spectrum), field size and SSD. The relation between two PDD values at the same depth \i d\i0  in water at different \i SSD\i0 's can be described by

\par \b Limitations\b0 
\par The field size is rather problematic in the Mayneord factor. In general the best results are got when the field size at the surface is kept constant. But still the divergence of the beam will be different, leading to differences in scatter contributions. In general the Mayneord factor overestimates the PDD at a larger SSD. As scatter becomes more important at larger depths and lower energies, the Mayneord function may produce significant errors.

\par The most essential configuration for daily use is the reference depth and value for photon beams.
\par The reference depth is used to \cf2\strike normalise depth dose scans\cf3\strike0\{linkID=8\}. \cf0 Thus all displayed analysis values are based on this normalisation  ("\f2 AbsDepth/AbsValue\f0 "). The graphical display of the depth dose curve has its own normalisation ("\f2 RelDepth/RelValue\f0 "). When combined with a reference file calculated division will be normalised at the same depth. Although the shape of the division will not change drastically the found minimum and maximum will be different. When using generic beams or reference dosimetry at a specific depth this might be the optimal setup.
\par When the dosimetrical system is based on a depth beyond dose maximum, all depth dose curves should be evaluated realative to this reference point. The text "PDD" is then changed to "RDD".
\par There are several possibilities to use this:
\par 
\par \b\i No entries
\par \b0\i0 The program will normalise the depth dose curve to 100% at the depth of the found dose maximum.

These data sets, multiscan files included, are complete data engines with all related parameters. When opening a new file always the actual settings from the user interface are taken. 
\par \cf3\{bmc history_next.gif\}\cf0 
\par The History list is a linear list but behaves circular, \f2 <Ctrl>+<PageUp>\f0  will move to the previous data; \f2 <Ctrl>+<PageDown>\f0  will move to a later (or the oldest) data. When a data set from the history is presented (i.e. not the last loaded) then in the window title the 'historic position' and actual list size are shown as \f2 --\i i/n\i0 --\f0 . When frozen (see below) a asterisk is added. When data have to be pushed out because new data sets are added, the earliest opened will be replaced.
\par This cycling feature is designed to be completely equivalent to using a single data set: also all buffers and the editor are restored to guarantee all functionality. When a \cf2\strike temporary reference\cf3\strike0\{linkID=71\}\cf0  is set this will be transferred to the next data set upon cycling. This also works for multi-scan data sets. Whether or not such passed refference data will be used depends on the receiving data set and the settings in the \cf2\strike Processing menu\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=check_tempref_type\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \i Use history list\i0 
\par When checked BistroMath will maintain a list of data sets. The first data set in the list will be displayed. All data will be set to (un)frozen when the state is changed to (un)checked. See below for explanation.
\par 
\par \i length\i0 
\par This sets the length of the history list whether it is used or not. A value of 1 will uncheck \i Use history list\i0  and disable \i No recalculations on history data\i0 . When the displayed data set is removed from the history list by reducing the list lenght, the first data set in the list will be displayed.

\par 
\par \i Put history data in frozen state\cf3\{target=unfreeze\}\cf0\i0 
\par When checked the data sets are not compressed but stay in a "frozen" state. No synchronisation is done between user interface and a frozen data set. Note that loading new data will always unfreeze the current data set. Using \f2 <PageUp>\f0  or \f2 <PageDown>\f0  without \f2 <Ctrl>\f0  to step through multiscan data will also unfreeze that data set. With unfrozen data the reference is loaded again and all necessary calculations must be done again. Also a manual applied shift is lost.
\par In all cases, when data are unfrozen, the current settings from the user interface will be taken and differences with the state before might occur.
\par There are both advantages and disadvantages to using the frozen state:
\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 Freezing takes much more memory.\lang2057\f1

For \cf3\strike gamma analysis\cf2\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  the scaling has a major effect on the results. Therefore an additional normalisation factor can be introduced.
\par 
\par \b Relevancy\b0 
\par Any renormalisation is only meaningful when a comparison with a reference is done.

\par 
\par \b Ionisation to Dose conversion\b0 
\par  This menu item cannot be checked to activate it for all following data like other items in the \i Measurement menu\i0 . Its intended use is application by the user (\f2 <Shift>+<D>\f1 ) \i after\i0  the date have been read. When the conversion is succesfull the menu item will be checked to reflect the current state. It is always reset for the next curve. The user is responsible for applying this function to the appropriate data: electron depth dose curves measured with ionisation chambers. There is no way to detect the used detector type in BistroMath. The other two conditions (electrons, depth dose) will be checked however. This function can be applied only once on a data set. Returning to the original data is possible by rereading the data (\f2 <Ctrl>+<L>\f1 ). See also the \cf2\strike scientific backgrounds\cf3\strike0\{linkID=125\}\cf0 .

\par \cf3\b\{target=axis_preservation\}\cf0 Preserve original data on export\b0 
\par This option in the Measurement menu regulates the effects of axis swapping on export. Its default state is \i on\i0 . Switching off this option introduces serious data integrity problems because swapped data will be interpreted as original, unswapped data when opened again from file. This can undermine institution wide conventions for data interpretation. Therefore the state of this menu item is always \i on\i0  at startup and is not taken from any configuration file. Moreover the item is \cf2\strike locked at program start\cf3\strike0\{linkID=56\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \b Invert axis (axis swapping)\cf3\{target=invert_axis\}\cf0\b0 
\par The direction of the data representation on the screen may be inverted when comparing side by side with the measuring system. The axis designations and/or the axis direction might be wrong. With these inversion options the axis sign (direction) is inverted at file read time and is reflected in the \cf4 bottom axis labels\cf0 . This has effect on all relevant analysis results..
\par 
\par \b Alternative axis setup\cf3\{target=alternative_axis\}\cf0\b0 
\par When, for any reason, the data columns for the coordinates do not meet the format conventions or are registered as the wrong scan type, this can be corrected by specifying the correct order of \b I\b0 nplane, \b C\b0 rossplane and \b D\b0 epth in the \cf2\strike advanced settings tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=129\}\cf0 . The feature is only used if \i Alternative axis setup\i0  checked. Axis swapping and axis sign inversion are applied as configured.

\par For Point to Point scans and Free scans the data are represented in a 3D set. When checked and the difference in depth between start of scan and end of scan is more than 3 cm, the correct path length is calculated along the scan axis. The zero position is set to the water level. The 3D data set is recalculated to represent a pure PDD preserving any offset along inplane and crossplane direction as refered to the water level.

\par The conversion from Ionisation to Dose is only valid for electron beam data measured with a ionisation chamber. The energy deposition of a high energy electron starts as soon the electron enters the water. This is fundamentally different for photon beams where energy deposition starts where at some depth the photon interacts with the water. The energy dependent stopping power ratio from air to water for electrons should be used to aquire a true dose. Therefore this should not be applied to diode or likewise solid state detector data. 
\par The detection of the detector type from different data sources is unreliable and therefore ignored however. The users awareness on this is required. The conversion is actively limited to unconverted depth dose curves or fanline curves of a electron beam or undefined beam. 
\par  When the conversion is succesfull the menu item will be checked to reflect the current state. It is always reset for the next curve. The user is responsible for applying this function to the appropriate data: electron depth dose curves measured with ionisation chambers. This function can be applied only once on a data set. Returning to the original data is possible by rereading the data (\f2 <Ctrl>+<L>\f0 ).

\par \b Design goals of BistroMath\b0 
\par Virtually all commercial available software assumes that the center of the field is in the origin. When both penumbras of the profile are on the same side of the origin, this field cannot be analysed. These fields are part of a jaw calibration procedure and therefore should be processed in BistroMath as design goal. This design goal was met by defing the \i center of field\i0  (CoF) is the average of left and right penumbra positions. As further expansion of this design setup this point should also be taken as \i normalisation\i0  point.
\par Taking the origin as CoF imposes the need for a careful setup of your data collection system. Water phantom scanning software offers a CAX-procedure to accomplish this. However this is also prone to analysis challenges and residual errors. With a symmetric field the CoF can be taken as alternative for the origin, offering the option to skip the CAX-procedure. Any reference profile can be easily moved to the same CoF position as the reference. Therefore a twofold uncertainty in the CAX-procedure can be avoided. Of course, any deviation in the jaws/leaves will also introduce small errors in the correct CoF. For very small fields \i always\i0  the CoF (=maximum) should be taken as unertainties in jaw/leaf-posiitons becomes dominant and the origin clearly is not the correct choice. The design goals of BistroMath overcome all these difficulties.

\par \cf0\lang1043\b Calculation of normalisation value\b0 
\par \i These settings are found on the \cf3 Field Types tab\cf2\{linkID=130\}\cf0\i0 .
\par Normalisation of noisy data at a position possibly without data is non-trivial. Poor vertical alignment results in visualy exaggerated differences. Also the \cf3\strike Gamma analysis\cf2\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  will degrade. For the division of measurement and reference this is not a problem as this curve is rescaled after median filtering anyway.\strike 
\par \strike0 The standard approach of Bistromath is to calculate an avarage over a small area, the user configurable setting \cf3\strike Calculation width\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=calculationwidth\}\cf0 . This gives mostly a reliable result. 
\par For comparison across different linacs there might be more pronounced differences. Also the exchange of a gun filament may introduce unexpected differences. In the classical approach all differences are shown in relation to the central normalisation point.
\par To evaluate what is "acceptable" alternative normalisation points can be used. In the example above both measurement are normalised to the average over their In-Field area. Now both curves are not set 100% at the normalisation point as can be readily seen. The measurement normalisation may also be multiplied by the \cf3\strike normalisation Level\cf2\strike0\{linkID=129\}\cf0  to shift it to any level. These actions influence the results for normalisation value, maximum, and minimum and maximum over the In-Field area. Therefore these values are displayed in \cf4 red\cf0 .

\par \i Auto set decimal separator for: (a list of characters)\cf3\{target=decimal_point\}\cf0\i0 
\par In countries with the comma as standard numeric decimal point symbol files might be stored with the comma is separator. BistroMath expects a dot symbol as decimal separator and will not start when the localisation does not meet this requirement.
\par Still there can be files with the wrong format. When this option is checked, BistroMath will first count the number of occurences for each of the symbols given. The most-found symbol will be applied. The drawback is that this will be done for every ascii file which takes extra processing.
\par A caveat might be that for a correctly formatted file wit a lot of commas in the header and few data points the wrong symbol is selected. Therefore it is advised to use this feature only when needed. When a file fails to open unexpectedly it will be retried when this option is checked and the user returns to the \i Analysis\i0  tab.

\par With few points and much noise or gradient changes a second order fit may give unwanted results.

\par When due to missing penumbra(s) the center of field position is not valid the origin can be used for normalisation. This will only be done if the value at the origin is an acceptable fraction of the maximum. When not fullfilled, the maximum will be used.

\par When the option \i Fit PDD to buffer\i0  is checked, a model will be used to fill the buffer. Also the difference between data and model is plotted as dots. This difference also drives the model optimisation in the right direction.
\par For photons the \cf2\strike model\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=JWmodel\}\cf0  works extremely well, and the \cf2\strike results\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=fittestresults\}\cf0  of the (noise free) model can be used for analysis by checking \i Use PDD-fit results\i0  in the measurement menu option.
\par The difference between model and data is ultimately expressed into one single value: the cost function. It consists of several components:
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 The summed squares of the difference between model and data over all depths.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}A buildup power factor in the model itself for the photon \cf2\strike model\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=jwmodel\}\cf0  to avoid oscillation of the fit, which was sometimes observed. It can be set to a fixed value between 0 (now power factor) and 5. Alternatively the difference from 1 can be optimised.:
\par \pard\tab\cf1\lang0\f2 pdd = I\fs16 1\fs20 *exp((-\lang1033\f0 mu\lang0\f2\fs16 1\fs20 +(\lang1033\f0 mu\lang1043\f3\fs16 2\lang0\f2\fs20 +(\lang1033\f0 mu\lang1043\f3\fs16 3\lang0\f2\fs20 +\lang1033\f0 mu\lang1043\f3\fs16 4\lang0\f2\fs20 *\lang1043\f3 z\lang0\f2 )*\lang1043\f3 z\lang0\f2 )*\lang1043\f3 z\lang0\f2 )*\lang1043\f3 z\lang0\f2 ) - I\fs16 b\fs20 *exp(-mu\fs16 b\fs20 *\lang1043\f3 z^\fs16 mub_power\lang0\f2\fs20 )
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\cf0\lang1043\f0 The summed squares can be weighted by depth by dividing each squared difference with \cf1\f3 z^z\fs16 _power\cf0\f0\fs20 . A value of 0 sets the power funtion to 1 for all depths and a value of 1 equals the function to \i z\i0 . Increasing the z-power will shift the weight to lower depths.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}The \i Error to Noise Ratio\i0  is an estimate of the slowly evolving differences between model and averaged data in relation to the noise level. In the cost function this is for speed reasons implemented by summing the squares of the summed signed differences within a small number of overlapping regions. In the final calculation after optimisation a sum of signed diferences is calculated within a individual region for each point. The noise level itself is calculated from the difference between data and a filtered version of the data. When this ENR is above the limit the fit will be restarted until the maximum number of restarts is reached. Since the inherent noise level in the data is highly dependent on detector characteristics, averaging (measuring speed, number of points) and electronics, no general advise can be given here.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}The Nelder-Mead optimisation is an endless loop. The code has to decide how to stop it. In general there are three parameters involved: the rate of change of the cost function, the number of cycles and the calculation time. The latter two can be set. A zero value for the cycles is set to a default of 100+3^#parameters.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}\{target=NMenr\}\cf0 The Nelder-Mead method may give much better results by restarting is several times. The actual applied number of restarts is somewhat fuzzy. At the start the number of restarts is calculated as: \cf2\f3\fs16 EngineMaxRestarts:= Ceil(twcNMrestarts/Max(1,(Amoebes-1)/2));\cf0\f0\fs20  where the number of amoebes is set to the available CPU's (cores) minus 1. Afterwards the ENR is calculated. If this exceeds the set ENR criterium, the number of engine restarts is decreased by 1 and the loop is repeated until the number of restarts reaches zero or the ENR criterium is met. Always the total sum of restarts by engine and loop is reported.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}The parameters mu3, mu4 and mx2 are related to the photon model and electron model respectively. When checked they will be given a meaningful start value and will be part of the optimisation. When unchecked their starting values are set to zero. The Nelder-Mead method will leave them unchanged as all changes are a (randomised) multiplier with the original value. In general the result will degrade significantly when pameters are switched off.
\par \pard The buffer data are normalised to the dose maximum and can be \cf2\strike saved as selected curve\cf3\strike0\{linkID=50\}\cf0 , including all fit parameters.
\par Starting with version 3.08 the optimisation engine is made multithreaded. On every restart the best result is distributed over all threads.
\par Note: the Nelder-Mead engine is also used for fitting the dose maximum of a pdd, the top of a FFF profile and the \cf2\strike sigmoid fit\cf3\strike0\{linkID=15\}\cf0 , but in all these cases the number of parameters is low and with good starting values, these models are completely stable and will reach their optimum values quickly. Time and number of cycles are not relevant here.

\par \cf0\lang1043 Field Type related settings for both detection and analysis for all defined types can be found here. See also the introduction to the concept of \cf2\strike Field Types\cf3\strike0\{linkID=23\}\cf0 . 
\par 
\par \b On Borders and Edges\b0 
\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 A \i Border\i0  is defined as the position a certain fraction of the \i normalisation\i0  value on both sides of the penumbra. Therefore these points have by definition the same level. Possible values are 'dLow', 'dHigh', 'd20', 'd50', 'd80', 'd90' and 'dUser', where \i dLow \i0 and \i dHigh \i0 are configured as 20% and 80% respectively for photons and 50% and 90% respectively for electrons. \i dUser\i0  is open for the user to set at any level.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}An \i Edge\i0  is a position defined by some mathematical function at a (somewhat) variable, unknown, level. Possible values are \cf2\strike 'Derivative'\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0  and \cf2\strike 'Inflection'\cf3\strike0\{linkID=22\}\cf0 .
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}An in-between value is 'Sigmoid50' which is based on the \cf2\strike Sigmoid model\cf3\strike0\{linkID=22\}\cf0 , but uses this function to calculate the 50% level. It should be very close to the classical \i d50\i0  position but more stable for sparse data.
\par \pard Therefore a \i Border\i0  is dependent on the \i Normalisation\i0  position which might be also depend on the \i Center of Field\i0  definition. This basically is an endless loop as one might depend on the other. Bistromath resolves this complication by doing a dual loop analysis in which preliminary results lead to stable final results.
\par 
\par \i Detect\i0 
\par Whether or not detection rules are applied for a certain field type. The \i Standard\i0  type is anything that is not assigned to another type. Therefore detection is not relevant for the \i Standard\i0  type.
\par 
\par \i Measurement symmetry correction\i0 
\par Asymmetry of the measurement can be corrected. The methods are described in a \cf2\strike separate topic\cf3\strike0\{linkID=131\}\cf0 . Normally this should be \i off\i0 . During beam adjustment it \i might\i0  be handy to separate energy effects and beam alignment affects. Note that this setting is \b smart linked\b0  to symmetry correction setting in the \cf2\strike Measurement menu\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0 : changing it in the menu will be reflected om this page. With every new profile the menu setting is set to the state on this page for the detected field type.
\par 
\par \i Reference symmetry correction\i0 
\par Also reference data might be prone to small assymmetry effects. These can be corrected. This is the most relevant for \i Standard\i0  profiles. This setting is \b smart linked\b0  to the Symmetry correction in the \cf2\strike Reference menu\cf3\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \i Dynamic penumbra width\i0 
\par \cf1\strike NCS-33\cf3\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("https://radiationdosimetry.org/ncs/quality-control-for-linear-accelerators")\}\cf0  introduces the penumbra width based on levels scaled with the height of the inlection point:
\par \cf3\{bmct NCS33_3-2-6.gif\}\cf0 
\par 
\par In Bistromath this is available as "dynamic penumbra width". For each field type a preference can be set. Note that this can be overridden in the \cf2\strike Results Panel\cf3\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  (rule 'p'). When actively applied, the label is denoted with a asterisk ('\i Left*80-20\i0 ).
\par \cf3\{bmc result_dynamicpenumbra.gif\}\cf0 
\par 
\par \i Primary border/edge definition\i0  and \i Fallback border/edge definition\i0 
\par The primary definition of the field border is applied unless its application is overruled because the primary definition fails or defined rules for that Field type dictate to use the Fallback definition.
\par 
\par \i Center of Field definition\cf3\i0\{target=CoF\}\cf0 
\par BistroMath leaves it to the user to use appropriate choices. Possible values are 'Border/Edge', 'Origin' and 'Maximum'. Please note the general remarks above on the recursive character.
\par 
\par \i Normalisation definition\cf3\i0\{target=normalisation\}\cf0 
\par BistroMath leaves it to the user to use appropriate choices. Possible values are 'Center', 'Origin', 'Maximum' and 'In-Field area'. Please note the general remarks above on the recursive character.
\par \pard\tx200 The normalisation of depth dose curves has \cf2\strike its own rules and is highly configurable\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0  to local standards or protocols.\b 
\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\b0 Center of field:\cf3\b\{target=norm_center_meas\} \cf0\b0 This option forces the normalisation point, for profiles only, to be taken at the geometrical centre of the field. If unchecked the central axis is taken. When there are no data for the central axis (\i origin\i0 ) or the central axis value is less then 10% of the maximum, also the centre of the field is taken.
\par \i{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Maximum\i0 : the maximum within the profile is taken as normalisation.
\par \i{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Origin\i0  (central axis): the standard in classical radiotherapy.
\par \i{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Average In-Field area\i0 : the normalisation value will be adjusted to the average over the In-Field area. \cf4 This feature produces results outside the scope of the current conventions in radiotherapy\cf0 .
\par \pard 
\par \i Center Model radius (cm)\cf3\{target=Topmodel_radius\}\cf0\i0 
\par The range of data around the maximum or center of a profile, always limited to the In-Field area, used to fit a second order polynomal function, the \i Top model\i0 . This feature is designed to describe the position and shape of the top of a FFF profile. The top of these profiles might differ from the field center as defined by the field borders. The difference can be used to adjust the beam parameters. For this application a radius of 2.5 cm is shown to work reliably. A value of zero will ignore this model.
\par There is a wider application for this model: it can be used to describe the overal shape of (a part) of the In-Field area of any profile. This might be used to set the volume correction for a detector. As such there is no advice for how to set the range; it depends highly on the intended use.
\par The display of highest order parameter, the curvature, can be configured in the \cf2\strike Results Panel\cf3\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0 , but is not in the standard panel list.
\par \tab\{bmc curvature.gif\}
\par 
\par \i FFF detection\cf3\{target=fff_detection\}\cf0\i0 
\par These parameters are described in the \cf2\strike FFF profiles\cf3\strike0\{linkID=149\}\cf0  topic. Activation of these detection rules is governed above.
\par 
\par \i Edge Detection and related parameters\cf3\{target=edgedetectionlimit\}\cf0\i0 
\par As base rule the field border is found at 50% of the normalisation value. For wedged fields this gives an unacceptable result. This is tackled by using a derivative function combined with statistical analysis to find the edges. See \cf2\strike Edge detection\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0  for details of this advanced process. The same can be done to detect non-flat beams like the FFF beams. Based on the found derivative edges a sigmoid function can be applied on the edges.
\par When the the derivative edge position differs more from the 50% than a given value \i Edge fallback (mm)\i0 , and this function is activated the "fallback" method will be used. Center and border values are displayed in a teal color. For film data the difference limit is ignored and edge data is used when this option is checked.
\par Setting the difference limit to zero will force using the fallback method for any profile.
\par For double-wedge profiles this option should be switched \i off\i0  as for these profiles the steepest slope position might significantly differ from the 50% position. The latter is usually the objective for these profiles.
\par When Edge Detection results are actively applied, results are denoted with "(e)" for derivative, "(i\i nn\i0 )" for the sigmoid inflection point where \i nn\i0  is the level at the inflection point and "(s)" for the sigmoid based 50% value. These annotations \cf2\strike can be suppressed\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=no_edge_annotation\}\cf0  when used as primary method.
\par \i Sigmoid radius\i0 
\par For sparse data the \cf2\strike sigmoid model\cf3\strike0\{linkID=22\}\cf0  offfers slightly better results. The radius should (roughly) cover the full range of the penumbra region. The default of 10 mm showed to work fine for all tested cases.
\par \cf3\{target=reverse_sigmoid\}\cf0 For conventional profiles the sigmoid model may be used as an alternative model for the penumbra to calculate either the inflection point, the 50% level or even the \i nn\i0 % user's level. BistroMath has a reverse calculation model for this purpose. There are rules to use other levels than the inflection point: the ratio of requested level and low sigmoid level should be larger than 1.1, with the high sigmoid level smaller than 0.9 and within a range of 0.85-1.15 with the level at the inflection point. These rules will not be met for FFF profiles.
\par \i Small field width\i0 
\par Below this value fields will be assigned to the Small Field type.
\par \i Wedge 90% level shift factor\i0 
\par When the \i Right\i0  90% level position is on the \i left\i0  of the field center or the \i Left\i0  90% level position is on the \i right\i0  of the field center, a field is considered to be of the Wedge type. A more negative value will increase the sensitivity, a zero or positive value will swicth off wedge detection.
\par \i MRlinac detection\i0 
\par There is no fail safe profile based detection rule. Therefore the name of the treatment unit is compared against a comma separated list.

\par The method described above does not work well for \cf3\strike FFF-profiles\cf2\strike0\{linkID=149\}\cf0 . In that case the slope is defined as the sum of the left and right slope of the FFF-profile. For symmetrical profiles the sum will be zero.

\par This option is intended for selected \cf2\strike 2D-arrays\cf3\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0  with multiple curves with a fixed order in one single file. When applicable a reference may be stored in the original file format. The appropriate curve will always be taken from the reference file.
\par At this moment only the PTW Starcheck Maxi and Sun Nulear IC PROFILER are supported. Other devices may be added on request. This option needs specific information in the \cf2\strike configuration file\cf3\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0  to work properly. When this information is missing, this menu item will be disabled.

\par \cf3\b\{target=GenericBeams\}\cf0 Reference from Generic Beam List\b0 
\par With this option switched \i on\i0 , \i Generic Beam list\i0  becomes available in the \cf2\strike Confiuration tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=240\}\cf0 . Both this setting and the list can be stored in any configuration file.
\par 
\par \cf3\b\{target=ReferenceIndexing\}\cf0 Index multi reference\b0 
\par With this option switched \i on\i0 , much more possibilities are opened by making an index of all the scans in a reference file. Of course, this may take sisgnificant time as all these scans have to be analysed. Now different file formats for the \cf2\strike PTW Starcheck\cf3\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0  can be mixed and unsorted multi reference files can be opened as \cf2\strike temporarary reference\cf3\strike0\{linkID=71\}\cf0 . Note that any entry in a multiple scan file that cannot be analysed as qualified scan is simply ignored. Indexing large files might take considerable time however. When multiple scans qualify as reference, the first one will be taken.

\par \b0 When a measurement at some SSD is \cf2\strike rescaled to the default SSD\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=Meas2defaultSSD\}\cf0 , this option allows to take automatically the appropriate reference at the default SSD.

\par 
\par \b Align with measurement
\par \b0 If this item is checked the reference is \cf2\strike shifted towards the measurement\cf3\strike0\{linkID=134\}\cf0 , based on the difference in center position. As (mostly) there are small errors in the setup of the watertank, the standard choice is to activate this option. When unchecked also differences in block/leaf calibration are much more relevant.
\par 
\par \b Align on Top for FFF\cf3\{target=RefAlignTop\}\cf0 
\par \b0 If this item is checked (and enabled) the reference is \cf2\strike shifted towards the measurement\cf3\strike0\{linkID=134\}\cf0 , based on the difference in position of the \i top\i0  for a \cf2\strike FFF profile\cf3\strike0\{linkID=149\} \cf0 using the choosen model to calculate the top.
\par 
\par \b Normalise reference\cf3\{target=normalise_reference\}\cf0\b0 
\par With this setting normalisation of the reference curve is forced. Under most circumstances this will have little effects as the file comparison mode uses specific strategies to optimise the graphical overlay of the reference and the division itself will be normalised anyway. With \cf2\strike the addition of the reference to the measurement\cf3\strike0\{linkID=137\}\cf0  this might be a matter of choice.
\par 
\par \b Calculation is ...\b0

\par With gamma analysis the differences between a measurement and its reference can be condensed to one number which combines dose errors, typically in the In-Field area and position errors in the penumbra region on a normalised vector base. This vector gives the smallest distance of combined dosimetric error and position error. The unit length is defined as a reference distance in mm (\i Distance norm\i0 ) and dose difference in percent (\i Dose norm\i0 ). A dose difference can be calculated in two ways: as percentage of the local dose or as percentage of the normalisation value of the profile. In an area around each measurement point the smallest vector is searched. Very fine steps (\i Search Steps/mm\i0 ) with interpolation between points of the reference curve are needed to find a meaningful gamma value. Since the calculation is sensitive for noise a median filter is applied afterwards. The analysis of profiles is only done for relative values above a given threshold (\i Cutoff Percentage\i0 ) and beyond the buildup region of depth dose curves (\i Cutoff Depth\i0 ). Also, the search is stopped when no better point is found within the region limited to the initial distance to agreement mulitiplied by the \i Search factor\i0 . The result can be shown as calculated curve or histogram. The Confidence Limit, defined as the sum of the mean value of the gamma curve and the standard deviation multiplied with 1.5 of the same curve.
\par The vertical range of the Gamma curve in the graphical display is set with the \cf3\strike Histogram range\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=histogram_range\}\cf0  in the \cf3\strike Advanced settings\cf2\strike0\{linkID=129\}\cf0  tab.

\par \pard\lang1043\f0 If both standard penumbra analysis and first derivative fail, there is a matching method to align the reference.
\par The reference is shifted through an iterative process. In the first cycle the measurement is shifted to the left over the total profile span divided by the \i Match Range factor\i0 . In a number of steps, defined as the \i Match Step factor\i0 , the profile is shifted to the right. At each step the sum difference in the overlapping area is minimised by moving the reference vertically. This vertical movement is limited by the \i Match normalisation percentage\i0  at the position with the lowest cost function. Centered around this position the cycle is repeated along a smaller span. The iteration stops when the profile movement steps are smaller than half of the smallest distance between data points. It may be problematic to use the penumbra for matching. Therefore a \i Match inclusion limit\i0  is available.
\par The optimum vertical shift can easily found with good approximation by interpolation between the largest negative and positive correction.

\par \{bmc edge_detected.gif\}
\par \cf0\lang1043 As base rule the field border is found at 50% of the normalisation value. For wedged fields this gives an unacceptable result. This is solved by using a derivative function. The same can be done to detect non-flat beams like FFF beams and double-wedge profiles. When the difference is more than the given limit, the peak of the derivative is assumed to give the correct border. Center and border values are displayed in a teal color.
\par 
\par In the example the 50% values clearly differ from the derivative peaks. The difference exceeds the (default) threshold of 2 mm and therefore the derivative method is used. For film data the difference limit is ignored and edge data are used when this option is checked.
\par Setting the difference limit to zero will force using edge detection for any profile.
\par Using a \cf3\strike user dose level\cf2\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0  will override any edge detection.
\par \cf2\{target=mcc_doublewedge\}\cf0 With double-wedge profiles the FWHM is obtained to relate it to the beam energy. In this case both FFF detection and edge detection is \i not\i0  wanted because it will not produce field borders at 50%. Either switch off edge detection or introduce a high threshold.
\par \cf2\lang2057\{bmc doublewedge.gif\}
\par \cf0\lang1043 
\par \cf2\{target=edge_detection_theory\}\cf0\i Derivative method\cf2\i0 
\par \cf0 For a standard field the derivative of the profile will produce a clear maximum and minimum which can be used to find the inflection points in the penumbra. For the most beam limiting devices this closely resembles the 50% values. But the field edge detection for non-trivial fields like wedged profiles or partial profiles, where it is much more needed also needs much more analysis of the derivative. Here statistical approaches are used.
\par 1\tab The profile is filtered (optionally) with a quadratic filter.
\par 2\tab The first derivative is calculated.
\par 3\tab The derivative again is cleaned with a quadratic filter. The result is the brown \i Buffer\i0  curve in the examples above.
\par 4\tab Then repeatedly a histogram is made until a reasonable number of bins is achieved.
\par 5\tab Now the largest bin is defined as "\i dead band\i0 ".
\par 6\tab The first and last crossing of the derivative through the \i dead band\i0  are detected.
\par 7\tab The minimum and maximum of the derivative within this area are searched. These are the nearest data points to the edges.
\par 
\par This process works well for complete profiles, including wedged profiles but fails for incomplete profiles. Therefore additional analysis is needed.
\par 
\par 8\tab A profile is marked as "wedged" when the ratio of the profile data at the max and minimum of the derivative is larger than 4 (or smaller than 1/4).
\par \pard\fi-720\li720 9a\tab For non-wedged profiles the \i dead band\i0  should fall within the central 80% of bins. When the \i dead band\i0  is in the upper or lower 10% respectively the left edge or the right edge is declared invalid.
\par 9b\tab For wedged profiles the histogram is made around the area of the left and right edge. Now the upper and lower limits are 3% of the total range in the subset. This works well for a 60\'b0 wedge. A more shallow wedge will produce a much more markedly penumbra and should be found without problems.
\par 10\tab For valid edges the exact position is calculated by applying a quadratic fit to the found (nearest points to the) edge positions. 
\par \pard 
\par Partial profiles will produce one valid edge which still can be used for \cf3\strike profile alignment\cf2\strike0\{linkID=134\}\cf0 . When one edge is missing the center of the field is unknown and no shift to the origin can be calculated. Note also that no use is made of any accompanying information of the profile.
\par 
\par \i Sigmoid fit\i0 
\par After edge detection as described above, the area around the calculated edge will be used to fit a \cf3\strike sigmoid function\cf2\strike0\{linkID=22\}\cf0 .\cf2\lang2057 
\par \cf0 This sigmoid can be initialised right away from the already known edge information and is optimised using a \cf3\strike Nelder-Mead optimisation\cf2\strike0\{linkID=400\}\cf0 . The cost function is the summed quadratic difference between model and data over the penumbra region.\lang1043 
\par 
\par For noisy data sets or sparse data sets like the Starcheck Maxi the sigmoid fit possibly performs slightly better than the derivative based method because it uses all data in the penumbra region. For profiles with sufficient points the differences are small. In the example below the original data set (left) is resampled to a 3 mm grid (right). The inflection point of the sigmoid model is marked with "+". Both derivative approach and sigmoid model do not produce the 50% level. The Sigmoid model might also be used to \cf3\strike derive the 50% level\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=reverse_sigmoid\}\cf0 .
\par \lang2057 The sigmoid results can be \cf3\strike applied on the Buffer curve\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=apply_sigmoid\}\cf0 . Note that the inflection point still might become less reliable when applied on conventional profiles where the penumbra becomes an almost straight line.

\par \pard\i\f0 Introduction
\par \i0 Flattening Filter Free beams are beams without a so-called flattening filter which produces a more or less homegeous ouput across the whole field.\lang1043  Essentially this is only optimal for a certain region of depths and large enough fields. With modern planning systems, the need for such a flattened field is not critical anymore. When the flattening filter is removed the output will typically be tripled resulting in much shorter treatment times. The main application is brain tumors, where small fields and high doses are needed. For wide fields the advantage disappears because the intensity has to be adapted by a beam shaping device like the MLCto get the correct dose at each position.
\par By its nature the\cf3\strike  Flatness parameter\cf2\strike0\{linkID=5\}\cf0  is meaningless for FFF beams. Also the symmetry calculation will perform different on these profiles. Handling these data needs specific detection and analysis.
\par There is also discussion on the definition of "center of field". The classical approch is to take the average of both field borders. For FFF beams \cf3\strike alternative calculations\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=fff_center\}\cf0  can be chosen.
\par 
\par \i Detection\i0 
\par There are a lot of non-flat beams which are not FFF. Still the specific features of FFF-class beams need a special treatment.
\par Therefore a number of criteria are used which all have to be fullfilled. This behavior can be switched on/off as item the \cf3\strike Field Types tab\cf2\strike0\{linkID=130\}\cf0 . 
\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 The field size must be at least 10 cm.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Both penumbra's must be found. Incomplete fields are ignored.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The scan should be of the AB, GT or Angle type. A diagonal scan with a shifted measuring device will become a "free scan" when the origin is not crossed within 0.5 cm. Shifted scan parallel to the main axes are acceptable.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The dose value at the edge of the "analysis area" (in flattened beams the "In-Field area") should drop at least with a given percentage [\i Minimal dose difference (%)\i0 ].
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Inflection point should differ notacibly from 50% border [\i Min. edge difference (mm)\i0 ].
\par \pard\tx200 The latter two criteria are configurable and can be changed in the \cf3\strike Field Types tab\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=fff_detection\}\cf0 .
\par 
\par \i FFF beam tuning\i0 
\par There is a strong relation between symmetry and center of field. Therefore it can be extremely practical to \cf3\strike compare the profile with a mirrored version of itself\cf2\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0  in the \i Processing menu\i0 . Note that this \i can\i0  be combined with the measurement options for the \i Center of Field\i0 . There is no clear rule whether or not these should be combined. User discretion and insight is essential here.
\par 
\par \cf2\i\{target=slopes_config\}\cf0 Analysis and used parameters\i0 
\par There is not yet a general agreement on criteria for FFF beams. For QA comparing with a reference profile and evaluating the \i relative\i0  flatness, the core feature of Bistromath, is by far the best choice. For comparing different FFF beams some standard description is needed. The "roof shaped" area can be fitted with straight lines. The length of these lines represent also the calculation range for the \i slope\i0 . The central dome can be modelled with a second order function, in BistroMath called the \i Top model\i0 .
\par Both the maximum of the \i Top model\i0  or the intersection of  the slopes can be used to define the \cf3\strike center of the field\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=fff_center\}\cf0 . Alternatively, the top can be used as \cf3\strike alignment criterium\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=refAlignTop\}\cf0  without choosing this as center definition.
\par The \i slope\i0  area is at the outside based on the definition of the In-Field area (for a flattened beam) and at the inner side on the radius of the central dome shape. An extension value [\i In-Field area extension (cm)\i0 ] in the \i Settings\i0  tab can push the outer side further outwards or inwards with negative values.
\par The gradient is a measure for the FFF shape. The difference in measure can be a measure for the symmetry.
\par \pard Thus the average of the (absolute) slope is presented in percent per cm. The symmetry is calculated conventionally. Symmetry correction is done by applying the average of upward and downward slope over the whole profile.
\par The definition of \cf3\strike relative flatness\cf2\strike0\{linkID=5\}\cf0  remains unchanged.
\par The related graphical objects can be hidden through the view menu.

\par \lang1043\f0 BistroMath contains excellent \cf2\strike models\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=JWmodel\}\cf0  to fit depth dose curves. The values for the model parameters are optimised in a cycle through minimalisation of a cumulative error over all data points. Such a cost function is by definition \i user defined\i0  and ultimately compares the data to be fitted in some way with the model for a given set of parameter values. A widely used strategy to find improved parameter values in each cycle is the Nelder-Mead fit procedure. Decisions to quit the cycle can be based on any combination of the number of cycles, calculation time, cost function value and decline of the cost funtion result with each cycle. In BistroMath also an estimate of the fit error to measurement noise (ENR) can be used. 
\par The Nelder-Mead optimisation engine is also used for the \cf2\strike sigmoid penumbra fit\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0 . This model needs only \cf2\strike four parameters\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=enrico_fermi\}\cf0  which can be initialised from measurment data and is stable by design. Therefore this optimisation needs few cycles. The pdd models have a lot of parameters, are unstable by design and therefore need careful initialisation. The data are normalised to dose maximum for better agreement with the initial model settings.
\par A good introduction can be found on \cf1\strike Wikipedia\cf3\strike0\fs16\{link=*! ExecFile("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method")\}\cf0\fs20  \cf2\strike [1]\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=NMwiki\}\cf0 .\lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\f0 T\lang1033\f1 he Nelder\f0 -Mead method or amoeba method is a simplex method wich does a direct search on the target function without using derivatives. The simplex character is based on the usage of multiple target function values for finding a better estimate. For a \i n\i0 -parameter ("dimensions") function \i n\i0 +1 combinations of parameters ("vertices") are used.

\par 
\par The Nelder-Mead technique was proposed by John Nelder & Roger Mead (1965)\lang1043  [2]:\lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\f0 "A method is described for the minimization of a function of \i n\i0  variables, which depends on the comparison of function values at the (\i n\i0 +1) vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact."
\par 
\par \lang1033 The six-steps cycle as described on \cf2\strike Wikipedia\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=NMwiki\}\cf0  is implemented in BistroMath as a general optimisation model (http://bistromath.kegge13.nl/Nelder-Mead.7z) with a user defined target function. However, the parameters for reflection, expansion, contraction and shrinkage are \i adaptive\i0  in the sense that these values are based on the number of dimensions as published by Gao and Han [3] and not on the characteristics of the target function.
\par From the initial starting point for the model \i n\i0  extra variants are made. In BistroMath each of the dimensions is changed randomly over a \'b170% range of the original value to create a \i n\i0 +1 simplex. The initial starting point may be critical. By using a scaling factor always a normalised model can be used. The exact scaling can be done by evaluating the maximum in the resultant function.
\par When a initial parameter is exactly zero, it will not change in this implementation of the Nelder-Mead algoritm. This behavior can be exploited for switching off higher order components in the model, thus making it more stable.
\par 
\par The target function used here is a cost function that compares the \cf2\strike model\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=JWmodel\}\cf0  with the actual measurement summed over all depths. This cost function is minimised by the Nelder-Mead algorithm. With using just one initial parameter set for photons and another one for electrons the model is stable enough to produce good results in one single run. The Nelder-Mead algorithm has no stopping criteria by design. Usually the number of cycles, used calculation time and decline of cost function are observed. Restarting the algorithm several times may improve the results markedly. Starting with version 3.08 the code is started in multiple threads in parallel on different cores. After completion of all threads the best result is selected. On subsequent restarts this best result is distributed over all threads. Therefore evolution is now introduced in the concept. See the \cf2\strike implementation below\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=NMimplementation\}\cf0  for more details.

\par The models are unstable by design and need a good initial value. The experience shows that a one-size-fits-all initial value seems to be good enough. The fit is scaled with a correction factor to the dose maximum in the data. This ensures that the fit model always produces approximately 100% in the dose maximum and thus giving a more stable fit.
\par The Nelder-Mead algoritm does not have an end point nor a warranty to end around the absolute minimum. Dependent on the model a restart with the best result will possibly find a much better solution. Therefore a generalised model uses a mixture of calculation time, number of cycles, change of best score and number of restarts as limits. The \cf2\strike defaults may be changed\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ini_only\}\cf0 . In BistroMath an extra (external) limit is intoduced: the Error to Noise Ratio (ENR). The slowly changing model will give net error related to the local average of a series of points where the noise on the same points (SNR) can be easily calculated. For a good fit the model error should be smaller than the noise. When the \cf2\strike ENR exceeds a configurable limit\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=NMenr\} the\cf0  complete process will be started with a reduced number of restarts until the number of restarts reaches zero. The difference between model and data is plotted as small black dots and is essentially pure noise in the photon PDD as shown above. For electrons there are some small errors in the X-ray tail. The strange skewed lines of the error show the limited digital resolution of the measurement system. Here the model decreases continuously while the data take discrete steps. Also the photon data produce some strange patterns due to this phenomena.

\par Freeman Dyson: \b "\b0 In desperation I asked Fermi whether he was not impressed by the agreement between our calculated numbers and his measured numbers. He replied, "How many arbitrary parameters did you use for your calculations?" I thought for a moment about our cut-off procedures and said, "Four." He said, "I remember my friend Johnny von Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." With that, the conversation was over. I thanked Fermi for his time and trouble, and sadly took the next bus back to Ithaca to tell the bad news to the students. Because it was important for the students to have their names on a published paper, we did not abandon our calculations immediately. We finished them and wrote a long paper that was duly published in the Physical Review with all our names on it. Then we dispersed to find other lines of work. I escaped to Berkeley, California, to start a new career in condensed-matter physics.\b "\b0

\par Ascii files of OmniPro-Accept measuring system version 7, contain far less data then previous versions. Inline and crossline are from T to G and A to B respectively. The \i ratio\i0  column (6) has a limited resolution. The raw field value (column 5) gives much more detail but is not scaled with the (unknown) reference signal. Wedge information is missing. The mdyHMS AM/PM date format is also supported.
\par Diagonals are noted as DiagonalPmMp and DiagonalMmPp for GA-to-TB and TA-to-GB respectively. 
\par When data are made symmetrical in OmniPro, the \i Normalised field\i0  and \i Current field\i0  are set to zero.
\par 
\par \f3\tab\cf1 The "Normalised field" is the value that uses the normalisation the user has performed (without reference division).
\par \tab The "Ratio" is the normalised field value incl. the reference division.
\par \tab The .rfb file format does not preserve the current or the reference signal values, only the relative one.
\par \tab  If you open an .rfb file in OmniPro Accept 7.x, and generate the ASCII output, the relative value is stored under the "Normalised field" column,
\par \tab  because there is no data to perform the reference division and fill in the "Ratio" column.\cf0

\par PTW offers is a well establised platform. Multiple-profile files \cf3\strike are supported\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=multiple_profiles\}\cf0  for reading only. At this date the effects of phantom rotation have been checked (no influence on data).
\par However, the data for the Starcheck do not follow the conventions as described. No ordering of labels within a measurement is expected. Unknown labels are ignored but should have no influence on the data interpretation.
\par \lang1043 MCC files tend to represent absolute dose values in stead of relative dose values, thus leading to very small numbers (several orders of magnitude below 1). This messed up assumptions that can be made for relative profiles. Therefore, at conversion to the internal used data format, dose values are scaled to 100 when the maximum is below 50.\lang2057

\par 
\par \lang1043\f0 All data are internally represented in an extendend version of the OmniPro v6 format. The axis representations are from G to T, A to B and U to D repectively. Through time date structures were adden when needed. Therefore all file types are converted into this format on read time. For relevant file types like the MCC format separate data objects were written to hold the data in their original format.
\par The direction of the data along the axes and/or the axis labels can be \cf2\strike swapped\cf3\strike0\{linkID=13\}\cf0  by the user. Depending on the choices this might have consequences for `left` and `right` analysis values. As the same conventions are used for reference files this is of no consequence.
\par There is a caveat for the scan angle definition. The TA-GB diagonal nowadays is mostly noted as 45\'b0 angle with a positive T to G axis. In the OmniPro v6 format the positive direction is from G to T and hence the same diagonal is noted as 135\'b0. This information is inserted in the reference file name and must be user independent. In short: the scan angle is always represented in the OmniPro v6 convention.

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\b\fs32 Data type identification\cf0\b0\f1\fs20 
\par 
\par \f0 Due to the large variation in data types with sometimes multiple varieties the file type recognition is an important issue in BistroMath. The general strategy is try any known file type until succesful interpretation. When all options fail the last error is displayed in the statusbar while the history can be found in the \i Messages\i0  tab. When a data type is not recognised at all this is concluded at the first line mostly.
\par 
\par \cf2\lang2057\{bmc parsing_messages.gif\}\cf0\lang1033 
\par 
\par On this page the identification rules used by BistroMath are presented in the applied order.
\par 
\par \b IBA binary rfb format\b0  (as file from disk only)
\par The file must start with a P-type string of the version of the file. The string itself starts with "Version:". The first byte is the length of the string. In all investigated versions this was 14 ($0e). The next two bytes represent the integer type for the number of scangroups and, after a spacing of 6 bytes, the untyped string of 5 characters " CBEAM" should be detected for a valid header.

\par \pard\qr\cf2\lang1043\i\f0\fs16 910\cf0\i0\fs20 
\par \pard Mainly as specific expansions on standard applications, "speical modes" are available. The number of configurable parameters will be expanded as needed in coming versions. To start BistroMath with a specific mode add one or more "-SpecialMode\{number\}" strings to the command line by changing the shortcut:
\par \cf1\f2 
\par C:\\Program Files\\BistroMath\\bistromath.exe -SpecialMode1
\par \cf0\f0 
\par Starting with version 2.96 these modes are also available in the \cf3\strike Processing menu\cf2\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0 , but only visible in \cf3\strike Advanced mode\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=advanced_mode\}\cf0 . 
\par 
\par Further behavior of a special mode must be set in a \cf3\strike configuration file\cf2\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 , like \b bistromath.ini\b0  or \b institute.ini\b0  (noted below in \cf1 blue\cf0 ). Note also that \cf3\strike configuration file overloading\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=overloading\}\cf0  is a solid method to combine SpecialMode settings with a reliable basic setup. To create such a file use a plain text editor like NotePad and save the file with a '.ini' extension. 
\par 
\par Starting with version 3.23 the SpecialMode-strings as decribed below \i can\i0  be placed into a separate \cf1 [SpecialModes]\cf0  section. The section reading order is [AnalyseForm], [SpecialModes]. On writing a config file the data as found in the \cf1 [SpecialModes]\cf0  section will be written back into the file. Strings in the \cf1 [AnalyseForm]\cf0  section are lost. Also strings commented out will be lost. Advised is to preserve settings into a separate file with only a \cf1 [SpecialModes]\cf0  section; a combined ini-file is more convenient however.
\par 
\par 
\par \b Special Mode 1\b0 
\par This mode can load any measurement at startup. There is one mandatory string parameter, the file to load:
\par \cf1\f2 [AnalyseForm]\cf0\f0  (or \cf1\f2 [SpecialModes]\cf0\f0 )\cf1\f2 
\par SpecialMode[1]String[1]=C:\\Program Files\\Bistromath\\U04X10i40.txt
\par \cf0\f0 
\par 
\par \b Special Mode 2\b0 
\par Special mode 2 displays extra information on the statusbar, to the clipboard, and also writes it to the data window which is saved to a file.
\par \cf2\lang2057\{bmc specialmode2.gif\}\cf0\lang1043 
\par 
\par There are four mandatory \cf4 strings\cf0  for respectively: 
\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 profiles [1], 
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}wedge profiles [2], with float[2] for wedge detection as lower limit for the symmetry of a wedge field
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}FFF profiles [3],
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}depth dose curves [4]. 
\par \pard 
\par And optional parameters:
\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 Float 1 positive values are rounded to the nearest integer number of decimals to display the results.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Float 3 positive values put the resulting line on the clipboard.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Float 5 positive values start the export scheme as explained below.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}String 5 is the path name to a directory or a file. When the path is an existing directory this path is used to write the measurement, otherwise the file is used to add the data as described above.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}If set, string 6 holds the extension (and therefore file type) of the measurement file. The measurement will be stored on the configured path with the set extension.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}If set, float 6 selects the curve to be exported:
\par \pard   0=Measured, 1=Reference, 2=MeasFiltered, 3=RefFiltered, 4=Calculated, 5=Buffer, 6=RefOrg, 7=Unrelated, 8=Default
\par 
\par Each \cf4 string\cf0  consists of \cf4 code expressions\cf0 , separated by ",". Parts within brackets are [optional].
\par 
\par \fs24 [-|+]\{\cf3\i parameter\cf0\i0\}[\cf3\i curve selector\cf0\i0 ] [ [-|+]\{value\} ] [ \{\cf3\i operator\cf0\i0\} [-|+]\{\cf3\i parameter\cf0\i0\}[\cf3\i curve selector\cf0\i0 ] [[-|+]\{\cf3 value\cf0\}] ]
\par 
\par \cf3\fs20 parameters\cf0 : 
\par \b Supported parameters can be found in the \cf3 Evaluation Type\cf2\{linkTarget=evaluation_types\}\cf0  section.\b0 
\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 For the evaluation "u" which calls for the border postiton at \i users\i0  value, there is an added bonus: it be extended with any numeric value like "u\i nn\i0 " where \i nn\i0  will be replaced with the used dose level.\b 
\par \pard\cf3\b0 curve selector\cf0 :
\par The curve selector is optional: F (dsMeasured, default), M (dsMeasured), C (dsCalculated), R (deReference), B (dsBuffer).
\par Moreover, the curve selector might be overruled when muptiple curves are involved in the calculation.
\par \cf3 operator\cf0 :
\par Valid operators are, \b\fs24 -\b0\fs20 , \b\fs24 +\b0\fs20  , \b\fs24 *\b0\fs20 , \b\fs24 /\b0\fs20  and \b\fs24 &\b0\fs20  for average.
\par \cf3 value\cf0 :
\par The result for a value results in the average for left and right when no sign is found.
\par A minus sign (-\{\i value\i0\}) and plus sign construct (+\{\i value\i0\}) evaluate to left and right results respectively.
\par 
\par Examples
\par \tab "xR+\{\i position\i0\}" gives the value of the curve at +\{position\} on the Reference curve. 
\par \tab "y\{\i value\i0\}" gives the average of left and right positions at \{\i value\i0\} for profiles and right position for pdd's. 
\par The construct "y\{value1\}-y\{value2\}" is supported and will produce the average of the (absolute) distances at left and right side when no sign is given. For non-wedge profiles "x\{position\}" gives the average for symmetrical positions around the center position.
\par Small wedged fields without indication of that state might fail to be detected as such. Therefore a threshold value (Float[2]) may be introduced for the symmetry. When the actual symmetry is above this level, a open field will be handled as wedge field. Note that meaningful values are in the range of 1.0 to 1.5. Values smaller than 1 will ignore this threshold.
\par 
\par Examples:
\par When left and right y90 values are -8 and +9 respectively and y50 values -9 and +11 for a electron profile then
\par \f2\tab y90       =  8.5
\par \tab D90       =  8.5
\par \tab y-90      = -8.0
\par \tab y+90      =  9.0
\par \tab y-50+y+50 = 20.0
\par \tab y90-y50   =  1.5
\par \tab p         =  1.5
\par \tab y-90-y-50 =  1.0
\par \tab p-1       =  1.0
\par \tab y+90-y+50 =  2.0
\par \tab i         =  0.5
\par \tab i-1       = -8
\par 
\par \f0 Likewise x5 will produce the average y at x=-5 and x=+5 for open field profiles wher x-5 and x+5 will return only the value at the denoted position.
\par When activated, PDD-fit parameters are also written to the data window.

\par \pard\b Application\b0 
\par Although BistroMath can be used as a stand-alone analysis tool it is intended as extension to water phantom systems in radiotherapy and therefore should agree with viewing conventions in the water phantom system. As BistroMath has many features this might become confusing when different users use one or more installations of the software over one or more Windows platforms. Mostly an institute wide default behavior on all installtions for all users might be preferred. This page tries to address all aspects of installation and configuration.
\par \pard\tx200 The names of some settings in the configuration files have been changed in version 2.53. This is corrected by the setup program in \f2\fs16 bistomath.ini\f0\fs20  and \f2\fs16 institute.ini\f0\fs20 . for standard setups. When in doubt, check the settings and save them again.
\par It is strongly advised to use a "." as decimal separator in the regional settings of Windows.
\par 
\par \cf2\b\{target=update_configuration\}\cf0 Configuration file consistency\b0 
\par The installation program can convert all old parameters to the new standards in all configuration and preset files in the data directory. This feature can also be run without installing Bistromath on any other directory. Just run the installation file, select the data directory and deselect installation of BistroMath.

\par \b Startup logistics\b0 
\par At startup Bistromath will look for \f3 institute.ini\f0  in the standard datapath. If not found \f2\fs16 bistromath.ini\f0\fs20  will be used. On a default installation Bistromath will start correct without any configuration file. Of course, settings will not be as expected.
\par Alternative configurations can be used on the command line: \f3 bistromath.exe -config path_to_ini_file\f0 .
\par The user can load \f3\fs18 bistromath.ini\f0\fs20  after program start. See \cf3\strike Institute defaults configuration\cf2\strike0\{linkID=14\}\cf0  for more details.
\par The philosophy behind this behavior is to archive a uniform analysis outcome for all users on all platforms without losing the opportunity to store specific user settings. When a configuration file is opened, a line is written to the \cf3\strike messages tab\cf2\strike0\{linkID=300\}\cf0 . Additional, a \cf3\strike preset\cf2\strike0\{linkID=180\}\cf0  can be loaded to support a dedicated task.

\par \cf2\lang2057\{bmc axisswap0.gif\}
\par \cf0\lang1043 For most users it is prefered that the graph view matches with the profiles as seen in the watertank software.

\par \lang1043\f0 
\par This guide tries to describe different application scenarios and is work in progress. All comments are highly welcomed.
\par 
\par \b Before you start\b0 
\par In most cases Bistromath will be used in combination with some scanning software. It is advised to configure the \cf2\strike presentation of profiles\cf3\strike0\{linkID=12\}\cf0  (\cf2\strike orientation and sign\cf3\strike0\{linkID=13\}\cf0 ) on the screen such that it corresponds with the representation of the scanning software. Notably for inplane profiles there is a large variation between vendors. There are also \cf2\strike choices\cf3\strike0\{linkID=80\}\cf0  to make how depth doses should be normalised for calculations and presentation relative differences with a reference curve. As default Bistromath calculates a \cf2\strike division\cf3\strike0\{linkID=135\}\cf0  of measurement and reference profile. But this might also be a \cf2\strike gamma analysis\cf3\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0 .
\par If the the choices above are based on an institution wide policy, they should be \cf2\strike stored in the locked file\cf3\strike0\{linkID=14\}\cf0  \f2\fs18 institute.ini\f0\fs20 .
\par 
\par \b Adjusting beams\b0 
\par Although absolute criteria are certainly important, the essential feature of BistroMath is the\cf2\strike  detailed comparison\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2\}\cf0  with some reference situation. Bistromath offers you both in one go. 
\par The process starts with choosing a reference scan. Open this file and store it as \cf2\strike temporary reference\cf3\strike0\{linkID=71\}\cf0 . If the reference is of another machine you should \cf2\strike ignore\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=ignore_treatment_unit\}\cf0  this to make the reference acceptable. Now each measurement of the same type, depth and field size will be readily compared with the reference.
\par 
\par \b QA of linacs\b0 
\par In the opinion of the author of Bistromath QA-measurements should \i always\i0  be compared with a predefined reference. Also this is the unique feature, not offered by any major vendor. See the \cf2\strike reference overview\cf3\strike0\{linkID=2\}\cf0  topic for all details.
\par 
\par \b Save as reference\b0 
\par This option is \cf2\strike locked\cf3\strike0\{linkID=56\}\cf0  at startup.\lang1033\f1

\par \cf3\lang1043\f1\{bmc configtab.gif\}\cf0 
\par The most essential configuration for daily use is the reference depth and value for photon beams.
\par The reference depth is used to \cf2\strike normalise depth dose scans\cf3\strike0\{linkID=8\}. \cf0 Thus all displayed analysis values are based on this normalisation  ("\f2 AbsDepth/AbsValue\f1 "). The graphical display of the depth dose curve has its own normalisation ("\f2 RelDepth/RelValue\f1 "). When combined with a reference file calculated division will be normalised at the same depth. Although the shape of the division will not change drastically the found minimum and maximum will be different. When using generic beams or reference dosimetry at a specific depth this might be the optimal setup.
\par When the dosimetrical system is based on a depth beyond dose maximum, all depth dose curves should be evaluated realative to this reference point. The text "PDD" is then changed to "RDD".
\par \lang2057\f0 
\par \lang1043\f1 These values are joined with \cf2\strike Dose Conversion parameters\cf3\strike0\{linkID=40\}.\cf0  Because there can be different film types this may lead to multiple dose depth definitions for one energy. Starting with version 2.00 all definitions for one energy are kept uniform.

\par Up to v3.30 BistroMath was developed in Borland Delphi v7.2. Although that platform is old, it was convenient for this application.
\par But it has become challenging to install it on Windows 7 and above. For the sake of the future of the concepts embedded in this application it was decided to leave Delphi with some sadness and port it to an open source environment.

\par \cf1\strike Lazarus\cf2\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("https://www.lazarus-ide.org/")\}\cf0  is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a large visual components library (LCL) and uses the \cf1\strike Free Pascal Compiler\cf2\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("https://www.freepascal.org")\}\cf0  (FPC). The latter was initiated as an open source alternative to the highly popular Borland Delpi Pascal visual component library (VCL) and compiler. Both Lazarus LCL and FPC offer a high compatibility with Borland Delphi. This reduced the amount of work drastically. Borland added the Steema TeeChart library for charting. In Lazarus this is offered through \cf1\strike TAChart\cf2\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/TAChart")\}\cf0   which originates from the \cf1\strike TeleAuto\cf2\strike0\{link=*! ExecFile("http://teleauto.org/indexEn.php")\}\cf0  project. The differences between those are significant. Therefore the user interface itself needs to be rewritten, but a lot of code can still be reused. Moreover, large portions of the user interface have been copied/pasted from Delphi to Lazarus, which reduced the work also.
\par During development Lcl 2.0.6/FPC 3.0.2, Lcl 2.0.8/FPC3.0.4 and Lcl 2.0.10/FPC 3.2.0 were used. Upgrades introduced no problems.

\par \cf0\i Significant changes in configuration files\i0 
\par With the port to the \cf3\strike Lazarus/FreePascal\cf2\strike0\{linkID=980\}\cf0  platform all code has been reviewed. Large portions of the the user interface were reorganised and/or rebuild. Consequently visual elements were renamed or replaced with other structures. As configuration files use the name of the visual elements for storage, old configuration files, including presets, are not completely reliable. For renamed elements this is corrected automatically with the installed repair file \f2 BM\i nnn\i0 _renamed_elements.ini\f0 , were \i nnn\i0  is the build number. 
\par 
\par \i After upgrading
\par \i0 During installation there is the option to repair all configuration files. When this option is used the repair file (see above) can be removed.
\par If the repair file is found by BistroMath this file will be applied on the in-memory version of loaded configuration files when needed; nothing will be written to disk.
\par In all cases the user should check that all settings are as expected.
\par 
\par \i Manually rewriting all configuration files\i0 
\par When all configuration files are openend, checked for their result on all settings and rewritten, these files will be free from redundant data. Rewriting the institute defaults file \cf3\strike must be unlocked\cf2\strike0\{linkID=14\}\cf0 .\cf2

\par \lang1043\f0 
\par \i version 1.99\tab 25/01/2011\i0 
\par This version is a precursor of version 2.00 with a full selftest feature.
\par In this version only bugs are repaired which have been around for a indefinite time but stayed undetected due to their specific nature in hardly used features.
\par -parsing of floating point text-strings,
\par -unresponsiveness of "Accept zero steps" menu item when the same data were read,
\par -improved interpolation techniques for sparse data files,
\par -handling perfect vertical slopes en perfect horizontal profiles, see calculation details.
\par The usage of the OD to dose conversion parameters has been changed.
\par \i 
\par version 1.98\tab 17/01/2011\i0 
\par Minor bug repair: the normalisation stategy in version 1.97 introduced a graphics-only inconsistent normalisation of reference profiles.
\par As default name for the "File save" menu is now made from measurement parameters and measurement time.
\par Resolved bug: due to a bug in a library the extension of files was not set as expected.
\par Dutch/English translation mixup corrected.
\par \i 
\par version 1.97\tab 06/12/2010\i0 
\par An optional dual normalisation of depth dose curves is introduced to separate analysis and graphical representation. See \cf2\strike configuration\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0  for details.
\par It is backward compatible with configuration files of previous versions.
\par \i 
\par version 1.96\tab 29/10/2010\i0 
\par normalisation of depth dose curves can now be done at a specific depth and normalisation value. See \cf2\strike configuration\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0  for details.
\par It is made backward compatible with configuration files of previous versions.
\par The \cf2\strike Alias tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=20\}\cf0  now has a pop-up menu.
\par \i 
\par version 1.95\tab 13/09/2010\i0 
\par A faster memory management utility with memory leak detection is introduced. No leaks were found.
\par Resampling of data to a fixed grid is now supported. See \cf2\strike Settings tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0 .
\par The majority of the menu items which can be (un)checked now report their status in the message bar.
\par The naming convention for reference files has been changed. The previous naming convention is still supported for backward compatibility.\i 
\par 
\par version 1.94\tab 19/03/2010\i0 
\par For SpecialMode2 the construct \{\i constan\i0 t\i\}\i0 *x|y\{[-|+]\i value\i0\} is supported.
\par Also wedge information added. See \cf2\strike SpecialModes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0 .\i 
\par 
\par version 1.93\tab 09/03/2010\i0 
\par SpecialMode2 capabilities expanded: now for any \i y\i0  value the (right side only for pdd) \i x\i0  position is evaluated. In previous versions this was limited to 20, 50, 80, 90 en \i dUser\i0 .
\par Small speed optimizations were introduced.
\par Minor viewing bug repair: For pdd's the bottom axis minimum value sometimes was not reset when before a profile was displayed. To get a full window version again the unzoom or zoom command could be used. Now the bottomacxis is always set to the obeserved minimum and maximum position values.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.92\tab 01/03/2010\i0 
\par For noisy profiles with a low resolution the search strategy from center to outside for the penumbra values might end at the wrong calculation point because of the low slope in the beginning. Therefore now the search strategy is inverted: from outside to inside, which maximises the slope. Moreover a \cf2\strike fallback to a linear fit\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=quadfit\}\cf0  is used when a quadratic fit might give extreme results. The number of  points to calculate a dose in any curve using a second order fit is now \cf2\strike configurable\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 .
\par Small speed optimizations were introduced.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.91\tab 11/02/2010\i0 
\par The Wellh\'f6fer scantype "Angle", used for diagonal profiles, is supported. However, when tested there where files found with missing axis definitions for the water tank. Therefore an extra entry is made in the \f2\fs16 [WellhoferObject]\f0\fs20  section of the ini-file to have default values: \f2\fs16 ICD=-YX-Z\f0\fs20 .
\par More information is written to the status bar.
\par Bug repair: due to changes in a base library the SpecialMode2 strings could not be handled.
\par The relative flatness is no longer displayed witin brackets but as a second value after a "/".
\par The error tolerance for inconsistent data is improved.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.90\tab 01/02/2010\i0 
\par Files produced by CMS XiO are now supported. 
\par In SpecialMode3 the scan depth of a profile is inserted into the file name.
\par The upper and lower level definitions for both photons and electrons can now be adjusted in the settings tab as a percentage with a arbitrary value. In previous versions these values could only be changed in the \cf2\strike configuration file\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 . where they were stored as percentage. As (undescribed) design limitation these values were exclusively limited to the set values for d90, d80, d50 and d20. In this version these values are stored as fractions, but for backward compatibility values higher than 1 are interpereted as percentage.
\par For reference profiles the scan depth is now included in the file name to accommodate a wider range of references. When a file exists with the old name and no new one, the old file is renamed automatically.
\par \cf3 
\par \cf0\i version 1.80\tab 07/12/2009\i0 
\par In \cf2\strike SpecialMode2\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0  the scan depth of a profile and both x- and y-size are given.
\par A temporary reference is only used for curves of the same scan type.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.79\tab 11/11/2009\i0 
\par The concepts of \cf2\strike SpecialMode2\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0  are changed.
\par Bug repairs:
\par \tab In SpecialMode2 string#2 in stead of string#3 was used for pdd's.
\par \tab With the "File/Save as" menu item data were always written as Wellh\'f6fer ascii.
\par 
\par \i version 1.78\tab 29/07/2009\i0 
\par An earlier revision of the shift-function introduced a bug.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.77\tab 23/06/2009\i0 
\par Now a derivative is calculated tot determine the field limits of a wedge field and therefore the effective field. 
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.76\tab 01/03/2009\i0 
\par In one installation the penumbra-settings were not correctly deduced from the configuration file. Decent values are forced here.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.75\tab 26/01/2009\i0 
\par "SpecialMode"-options are introduced. See the \cf2\strike Special modes\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0  section.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.74\tab 03/11/2008\i0 
\par Minor bug: after swichting back from Settings tab to Analysis tab, the profile was reread with all menu's still in a blocked state. Therefore the current profile was not divided again by the reference profile. Now the menu's are enabled in due time.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.73\tab 04/04/2008\i0 
\par Bistromath does not accept scans with a zero step. Now this can be overruled with a menu item.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.72\tab 26/03/2008\i0 
\par Bug repair for version 1.7: when the missing penumbra option was switched on the analysis of electron depth dose curves went wrong. This option is now ignored for depth dose curves.
\par Minor bug repair for all previous versions: for non-wellh\'f6fer data the filename of the imported file was not transfered.
\par Display issue: the plotscaling for the measured curve was also used to scale the filtered curve. This guarantees an optimal aligment of both plots. However, the normalisation point in the graph may be slightly different from the actual value. Therefore, now the filtered curve is scaled with the normalisation point.
\par Now extra information may by put on the clipboard (see \cf2\strike configuration\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 ). This was made to produce data for the beam check.
\par 
\par \i version 1.71\tab 12/03/2008\i0 
\par Bug repairs in the conversion tab:
\par -the output type selection was messed up
\par -the filepath edits did not respond to keys used as shortcut in the View menu.
\par Also the result reporting in the conversion tab is extended.
\par 
\par \i version 1.7\tab 03/03/2008\i0 
\par The analysis is revised to support diagonal profiles and profiles with missing penumbra's. See the \cf2\strike calculation details\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1020\}\cf0 . This is now also handled correctly for reference files.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.61\tab 26/02/2008\i0 
\par Support for Schuster profiles is added.
\par For stability more error-handling was added.
\par Bug repair: symmetry values were calculated before an optional symmetry correction was done.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.60\tab 15/02/2008\i0 
\par A histogram page is added.
\par The minimum in the In-Field area is displayed when applicable.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.5.10\tab 07/02/2008\i0 
\par Bugs repaired:
\par -due to duplication of variable names the file name was not transferred in the file conversion tab (occurred only in version 1.59)
\par -a binairy file could not be selected as reference
\par -export to wms: mixup in co\'f6rdinates
\par -export from wms to wellh\'f6fer format
\par With the introduction of a temporary reference it is possible to use references of other linacs. As in the current concept the reference is added tot the measurement data, a lot of information is shared, which possibly no longer is identical. For now this is repaired partially. In the next major version each curve will have its own information data.
\par Improvements:
\par -profiles are filtered before division now,\lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\f0 -the information on parsing errors is more accurate.
\par Added functionality:
\par -all profiles can be erased with the View/Clear menu item,
\par -normalisation ont the field centre can now be enforced.
\par 
\par \i version 1.59\tab 28/01/2008\i0 
\par Now a measurement can be used as temporary reference.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.58\tab 30/11/2007\i0 
\par Every curve has now its own position information. This leads to an improved positional accuracy when two curves are divided.
\par A curve can be selected, which, in this version, has only visual effects.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.57\tab 22/11/2007\i0 
\par Wellh\'f6ferformat-fix: support for 'Point To Point scans'.
\par Bug-fix in Filesave-dialog: the filename of the input was actually used. 
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.56\tab 01/11/2007\i0 
\par Generic-format-fix: read error on two columns.
\par 
\par \i version 1.55\tab 25/10/2007\i0 
\par WDA-format-fix: wda-files produced by recent Plato versions seem to produce a slightly different header. This is also accepted now.
\par 
\par \i version 1.54\tab 18/10/2007\i0 
\par Position analysis at user dose levels can be toggled on/off.
\par The help file is extended.
\par When the mouse is clicked in the graph window, the cursor is moved to that position.
\par Bugfix: the vertical alignment of measurement and reference profiles could go wrong due to wrong normalisation values.
\par 
\par \i version 1.51\tab 09/10/2007\i0 
\par Position analysis at user dose levels is introduced.
\par 
\par \i version 1.50\tab 09/09/2007\i0

\par Support for generic profiles and hdf profiles was added. For selected file types a background may be subtracted.
\par The configuration will only be rewriiten at program exit if an autosave option is set.
\par Several minor bugs were repaired.
\par The clipboard may be ignored through a new item in the File menu.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.35\tab 10/12/2006\i0 
\par The depth of dose maximum is given for pdd-curves.
\par \lang1033\f1 
\par \lang1043\i\f0 version 1.34\tab 27/11/2006\i0

\par \pard{\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf6\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\i0 Bugfix: In the \cf2\strike penumbra evaluation engine\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=penumbra_evaluation\}\cf0  valid results were not recalculated when the normalisation value changed. The effect is only significant when the normalisation value differs significantly from the maximum value or initial normalisation value. This might be the case with double-wedge profiles where the 50% width is critical, the slopes are less steep, and a higher maximum at (possible) lobes is not used for normalisation. Also, do not forget to switch \i off\i0  \cf2\strike Edge Detection fallback\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=edgedetectionlimit\}\cf0  as for these profiles the steepest slope position might significantly differ from the 50% postion.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}Bugfix: For MCC files correct interpretation of the positions for diagonal scans would sometimes fail, leading to a zero scan length.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}MCC files tend to represent absolute dose values in stead of relative dose values, thus leading to very small numbers (several orders of magnitude below 1). This messed up assumptions that can be made for relative profiles. Therefore, at conversion to the internal used data format, dose values are scaled to 100 when the maximu is below 50.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}The annotations c,e and \i nn\i0 , where \i nn\i0  is a number, are added to positional results for \cf2\strike profile centering\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0 , \cf2\strike edge detection\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0  and \cf2\strike user dose level\cf3\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0  respectively.

This is repaired by saving these files as 'angle' scan. Also the detection diagonal scans is extended to overcome poor registration anyway.

\par \i version 2.22\tab 16/02/2013\i0 
\par The recently introduced axis swapping with both axis inversion in the graph area and swapping of direction indicators did not work as expected. In a readme file on the installation of OmniPro 7.4 some background information can be found. Version 7.4 complies with IEC1217 conventions while OmniPro v6 was based on IEC601. The main difference is the inline direction, which is from T to G in v7 and from G to T in v6. For now Bistromath uses from G to T direction to set up inline data. To get consistent analysis results not only the graphical representation but also the underlying data should be inverted. How this is handled in Bistromath is described in \cf2\strike Axis swapping\cf3\strike0\{linkID=13\}\cf0 .

\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}The inline direction in the undocumented \cf2\strike OmnipPro-v7\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=OmniPro_v7\}\cf0  format actually represents data from T to G and not G to T as assumed. This is mentioned in a readme file on the installation disk and is related to IEC1217. This was tested with a wedge field. The data can be rewritten to the \cf2\strike OmniPro_v6\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=OmniPro_v6\}\cf0  format with correct axis direction representation. Also a measurement time with one digit for the hours did not pass the filter. The workaround was: do not measure before 10 o'clock...
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}Bugfix: due to some code reorganisation reference data were stored into the working directory and not in the reference directory where they should be.
\par \pard\i 
\par version 2.20\tab 08/01/2013\i0 
\par \pard\tx200 The PTW data format can now be written also with the limitation that only single profile files are produced. Writing into a multi data file will only be developed when there is a broadly expressed need for this feature.
\par Comparing different file types and/or different tank setups might lead to a mixup of directions and would lead to significant larger complexity of the code. Therefore the data point reading code for all file types was reviewed and partly rewritten in such a way that the data are stored internally always as G\'bbT / A\'bbB / U\'bbD / L\'bbR. As the interpretation of the data itself is not changed, this review should have no effect for any previously generated data files. However newly written data files represent the internal storage conventions as decribed above.
\par This reduced complexity comes at a small cost. As data are not always presented anymore in the direction as measured, this might lead to an inverted bottom axis when compared side-by-side with the measuring system, which can be corrected with the newly introduced \cf2\strike Axis swapping\cf3\strike0\{linkID=110\}\cf0 .
\par \pard{\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf6\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 The addition of date and time to the file name has been made \cf2\strike optional\cf3\strike0\{linkID=129\}\cf0 .

\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}In the file conversion tab both the PTW and RFA300 were added to the supported list of file types.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}The interpretatation of G and T side is flipped for XiO files. For AB-profiles the direction is unclear but not critical because they are symmetric. In the physics module the wedge profile is always calculated on the GT-direction, ignoring the (UMC Utrecht) setup configuration which should lead to a wedged AB-profile.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}Bugfix: the normalisation on the average In-Field area, introduced in version 2.14, resulted in an illegal value for depth dose curves. Both data and logic are corrected.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}Bugfix: SpecialMode2 caused an endless waiting loop due to safety measures taken in version 2.11. Also, the wedge detection result was not used but merely the wedge angle, for deciding on the correct output string. 
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: Depth dose curves without buildup part (i.e. kV depth dose curves) caused a calculation error which is now handled properly.
\par {\pntext\f6\'B7\tab}For very small wedged fields, especially on larger depths, wedge detection might fail.

Despite recent code reviews the implementation of the Nelder-Mead optimisation worked flawless. It was the model itself that became unstable.

The improvement is quit spectacular.
\par After initial failing attempts to optimise also the buildup power factor now only the deviation from 1 (effectively no power factor) is included in the Nelder-Mead optimisation. When this still leads to unstable results the power factor can set fixed to any value between 1 and 2.  Also the Error to Noise Ratio is now added to the cost function. Both measures improve the outcome fully automatically in most cases. Alternatively some manual steering can be done.

\par Overview\i0 
\par  New: For the MR-linac a dedicated water phantom with two detector positions is developed. The acquired data have a partial overlap. A full profile or depth dose curve has to be calculated from the combined signals. Matching is optionally used to stitch two partial profiles. To work succesfully with partial FFF-beams a number of revisions was needed.
\par  New: Mayneord correction for photon depth dose curves.
\par  New: Full support for the\cf2\strike  Sun Nuclear IC Profiler export format\cf3\strike0\{linkID=61\}\cf0 . \cf2\strike This format\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=sna_ascii\}\cf0  can be exported from the Sun Nuclear software to file or clipboard. The latter provides a full link with BistroMath including dedicated reference files.
\par  New: Comparison of a profile with \cf2\strike a mirrored copy\cf3\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0  and \cf2\i\strike Maximum as center of field option\cf3\i0\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0  as tools for FFF evaluation.
\par  New: Evaluation of position and level of maximum in depth dose curve based on a quadratic fit on top. This might give slight difference with previous versions.
\par Improvements on the \cf2\strike results panel\cf3\strike0\{linkID=11\}\cf0  including the \i composite\i0  attribute for curves.
\par Improvements in matching for FFF and missing penumbra situations.
\par Improvements and bug fixes for the PTW (Mephysto) .mcc format.

\par Details\i0 
\par \pard{\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf4\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 Revision of the \cf2\strike edge detection function\cf3\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0 . One missing penumbra would invalidate the calculated center of field and both edge positions. Now any succesfully found edge will be valid. Extra measures to exclude false edges are taken. See the \cf2\strike detailed explanation\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=edge_detection_theory\}\cf0  at the \i Edge fallback\i0  topic.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Revision of \cf2\strike match-function\cf3\strike0\{linkID=139\}\cf0  to handle also (FFF) beams with one missing penumbra. The matching area is now limited to provide roughly the same profile values at both sides of the area. An initial calculated optimal shift is used to set a starting value for the cost function. The revised edge detection was needed here to initialise the process on a single edge. The match cost function is now normalised on the number of succesfully matched data points, which avoids poor matches based on few points.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}A minor revision of BistroMath's core function that \cf2\strike evaluates the field borders\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=penumbra_evaluation\}\cf0  of a profile. The results of a partial edge detection (see above) are now included in the final analysis results.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}A small improvement of the BistroMath's core function for final analysis. The maximum of a depth dose curve is now fitted with a quadratic fit to evaluate the position and height of the maximum. This might lead to subtle differences with previous versions when the maximum is used for normalisation.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}In early versions of BistroMath the original 3D coordinates of each data point were not stored in memory. On export the shift was applied to the reconstructed 3D coordinates. For these historical reasons the original 3D position data were not updated in previous versions when a shift was applied. This results in a wrong curve when the stored data of a merge (see below) were read as reference. Now all shift related data are updated. The \i Match\i0  function will become somewhat slower because it uses the \i Shift\i0  function frequently. For succesful merging (see below) the 3D-data are needed including any applied shifts. All shift-related code was removed from all export procedures.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Introduction of the \i\f3 composite\i0\f0  attribute for curves. When set the presented text in the \cf2\strike results panel\cf3\strike0\{linkID=11\}\cf0  is changed.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Alignment improved for partial curves: only the valid edges are used.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}The division of two curves is done with filtered versions of these curves. The profiles were aligned again after this filtering including a possibly needed match which is time consuming. Now an already matched profile is not matched again.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}All revisions above have been tested carefully and can handle all previously known non-standard situations as well as FFF beams with one missing penumbra. One original file of the .opab type with wedge profiles (toe at the target side, in IEC-601 conventions collimator=0\'b0) was converted to the rfb format within OmniPro. This file was opened in BistroMath and showed the correct wedge orientation. This profile was exported from BistroMath as OmnPro-6-format, PTW .mcc, RFA-300 .asc, wms ascii .wtx and wms binary .wda. Al those files were loaded in BistroMath again succesfully with a correct axis representation.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}As a result of all these revisions, for a FFF beam with one missing penumbra, the available field border will now be given. The field center and field width will still be unavailable.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Introduction of the \cf2\i\strike Mayneord\i0  transform\cf3\strike0\{linkID=77\}\cf0  for photon depth dose curves. The \i Mayneord\i0  transform can be applied from the \cf2\i\strike Processing\cf3\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0\i0  menu. Use it with caution!
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Introduction of the \cf2\i\strike Merge\i0  function\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=merging\}\cf0  in the \cf2\i\strike Processing\cf3\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0\i0  menu. All backgrounds can be found in the \cf2\strike Merging of scans\cf3\strike0\{linkID=72\}\cf0  topic.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}The \i Merge\i0  function produces a composite curve which can be set as reference. The Merge function also works for partial depth dose curves measured at different SSD's.

\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Bug fix for loading presets: when not in \cf2\i\strike Advanced mode\cf3\i0\strike0\{linkTarget=advanced_mode\}\cf0 , the preset needed to be loaded twice, to get the User Dose Level accepted. Now \i Advanced mode\i0  is switched on temporarily and restored to the original state afterwards. The default value for the user dose level in the dose calculation engine is set to 50% instead of the (intentional) illegal value of -100%.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: a (in the header reported) zero field size would lead to a needless rejection of the profile.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: The user option to swap axis signs could lead to wrong identification of the "positive" or "negative" diagonal. Any user swapping is now ignored during that evaluation.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: the \i Move profile to Origin\i0  was based on provisional results only. The final center position was only evaluated after the shift and therefore was not exactly in the origin. Now the exact center position is also evaluated before the shift.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Bug fix for freescan type. The distance to the starting point was incorrectly defined. Probably never used.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Bug fixes for PTW .mcc files.
\par \pard\tx200 Patch for \cf2\strike MCC-files\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=mcc_ascii\}\cf0 : versions with unreliable information on the scan angle ("SCAN_ANGLE=90.00") were found in the wild. A scan angle value of 90 is now ignored.
\par Due to an interpretation error the reported "SCAN_OFFAXIS_CROSSPLANE" / "SCAN_OFFAXIS_INPLANE" was mistakenly added to the \i crossplane\i0  / \i inplane\i0  positions instead of the intended offset in the \i inplane\i0  / \i crossplane\i0  position.

\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}The size of all texts except the menu is now enlarged automatically within some limits when the window is enlarged. This is only active for the Analysis tab where all text positions are calculated on a form resize. All other tabs have a static design and therefore need a also a fixed font size.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}With a refinement of the general reading strategy the correct conclusions on the file type are retained when a (possibly multi scan) file does not contain enough data points in a scan. This avoids needless attempts to read with alternative file types. As added bonus, the last displayed status message becomes more meaningful. Now multi scan files which combine real scans with single dose points "scans" can be read succesfully by discarding scans with too few data points automatically. This is the case with \cf2\strike PTW mcc\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=mcc_ascii\}\cf0  files generated by the \i MultiCheck\i0  program of PTW. When generated by \i BeamAdjust\i0  these files start with four legal scans. For this reason an upper limit of 4 scans was hard coded in Bistromath for all Starcheck based mcc-files in previous versions. This limitation is now lifted.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}In the \cf2\strike results panel\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=annotations\}\cf0  now any rescaling that changes the SDD is denoted with (z). For PDD's results are denoted with (f) when the fitted data are used.
\par {\pntext\f4\'B7\tab}Bugfix: The quadratic filter and median filter did not copy the input to output when no repeated filtering was allowed. This would lead to undefined results. However, effects of this to edge detection related behavior, were never observed in previous versions with the tested data sets. Now it was detected on a PTW scan with varying steps from 1 to 4 mm. When combined with the standard filter range of 6 mm this results in a very limited filtering range.

This lead in all previous versions to a wrong interpretation of the modality data in the \cf2\strike configuration tab\cf3\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 . As consequence the calculated division of measurement and reference could be normalised to a wrong level. On rewriting any configuration file these data will be separated with a " | ".

Negative values were handled correctly. As this format was only used for film data, all positions were relative anyway. To demonstrate the interpretation (see \cf2\strike description of format\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=hdf_ascii\}\cf0 ) in the selftest file \f3\fs18 selftest05_hdf.txt\f0\fs20 , the center of all voxels is shifted 0.01 cm to the left and, to compnsate this, the track start and stop are shifted 0.01 cm to the right.

Also, BistroMath now relies on its own calculation of the scanangle and overrides any scan angle information in a data file.

This limit is now set to 5 cm. When the Dmax for this transform was set negative or zero the actual Dmax of the measurement was taken. However, for orthovolt data a value of zero is meaningful here. Therefore now only a negative Dmax will be set to the actual Dmax.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}The Mayneord item is moved from the \i Processing\i0  menu to the \i Measurement\i0  menu. As processing item it could be applied multiple times to one data set. In the new setup it can be included in the main analysis stream.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}The Mayneord transform can now only be applied once to a measurement. Its application is now stored with the curve data as a separate flag.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}The power function in the photon fit model is problematic for negative z values. In this case the power function is now replaced with the z value itself (effective setting the power value to 1).
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}The Mayneord transform state is now explicitely shown instead of the more generic "composite" state for the measurement in the Results panel.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}The high order nature of the photon model leads to "resonances" of the model around the measured curve. Therefore the "error to noise ratio" (ENR) was introduced in version 2.86. For the orthovolt energies this leaves not enough weight to model the start of the curve. This can be overcome by switching off the ENR or giving the low z range a higher weight. The latter is now \cf2\strike introduced\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=neldermead_settings\}\cf0 . The user should experiment with optimal settings here.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}A parameter limiting mechanism is added to the Nelder-Mead code. Now the parameter \i\f3 I\fs16 1\cf1\f4  \cf0\i0\f0\fs20 is limited to a positive range.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}The \cf2\strike Nelder-Mead optimisation code\cf3\strike0\{linkID=400\}\cf0  was reviewed in a twofold manner. With some small reorganisations the code is made much faster without any functional changes. Afterwards this loop has been made thread-save and can now be started mutiple times in parallel on different cores. When all threads have completed, the best result is selected and redistributed on a possible restart of all threads. Therefore an evolution characteristic is now added to the original concept which improves the effectiveness significantly.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}There is now an overview of all relevant parameters for the fit of \cf2\strike PDD curves\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=neldermead_settings\}\cf0 . The Settings tab and Advanced settings tab have been sligthly reorganised to accommodate the overview.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}When there is still some analysis active, no new data are accepted to avoid multithreading conflicts.
\par {\pntext\f5\'B7\tab}Minor bug detected: with a multiple scan reference (i.e. a 2D array) the internal buffers were only partly cleared when the \i Settings\i0  tab was opened.

\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\cf2\i0 New: \cf0 A fundamental feature of BistroMath, normalising data to (mostly) 100 at some position, can now be \cf3\strike switched off completely\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=autoscaling\}\cf0 . Note that for any analysis this factor still is needed and used. Therefore switching Autoscaling \i off\i0  is only meaningful for the comparison of absolute data with a relative scaled data set and may be combined with the \cf3\strike measurement renormalisation\cf4\strike0\{linkID=112\}\cf0  feature.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 Support for \cf3\strike OmniPro v8\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=omniPro_v7\}\cf0  (myQA platform).

\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\i0 Minor bug: when a \i potential \i0 multiscan format, like the PTW .mcc, containing just one single scan, is used as reference from file, at reload of the scan this reference would be ignored. Now such a file is not marked as a multi-reference file.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Improvement: When in the \cf3\strike gamma analysis\cf4\strike0\{linkID=136\}\cf0  local dose is used as the base for the dose deviation, this is also displayed in the title on the vertical axis.

\par \pard version 3.30.01-20, 01/07/2020
\par \pard\tx200 build 651-684
\par \i0 Several test builds are being made with simplified and more standard code to improve the portability towards Lazarus. No functional changes should show.
\par All these changes are also incorporated in the upcoming version 4.00.\i 
\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\cf2\i0 New: \cf0 An extra option is added to the file menu to save also the filtered version of a curve (if available).
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New:\cf0  SpecialMode2 now also writes to the clipboard.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New:\cf0  Output of SpecialMode3 resampled data is now optional.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New:\cf0  In the \cf3\strike Processing menu\cf4\strike0\{linkID=70\}\cf0  an option is added to apply the calculated sigmoid fit to a copy of the measurement in the Buffer curve. This might be convenient to observe the results of the sigmoid fit.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 Beside of Advanced Mode a \cf3\b\strike Simple Mode\cf4\b0\strike0\{linkTarget=simple_mode\}\cf0  is introduced to hide a lot of features.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 The clipboard observer now ignores text data which start with "BistroMath" or are less or equal the \cf3\strike configurable value\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=ini_only\}\cf0  \i MinClipBoardBytes\i0 .
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 The add-mode for the \cf3\strike panel elements configuration\cf4\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  can now also be negative to clear all existing rules.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 Clicking on values in the Results panel will copy the result to the clipboard.
\par \cf3\b{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Major design change\cf0\b0 : The separate editor window is replaced by a raw data tab.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : In the reference information line the auto shift value is always displayed with a sign ("+" or "-").
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  When background subtraction is needed, an empty modality type is acceptable.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  More consistent behavior of the Zoom/Unzoom function.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : Rereading the configuration is avoided on change of the \i Advanced Mode\i0  status. Instead the \cf3\strike OD conversion mode\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=OD2dose_item\}\cf0  is enabled/disabled accordingly.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : The graph data for the \i buffer \i0 were not filled when the user set the \i buffer \i0 curve to invisible. Making the buffer visible again would have no effect until new data were read. This proved to be problematic with the port to Lazarus. Now the \i buffer \i0 graph data always contain valid data, even if not used. Also in the graph processing extra checks are inserted to assure valid data. As added bonus the View Buffer item now responds more intuitively.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  Loading the raw data in a viewer in a tab owned by the main thread through a separate thread shows to be problematic and is abandoned at the cost of some speed loss.
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  The sigmoid fit of the penumbra proved to be faster (and therefore better) when done as a single process in the main thread only instead of multiple competing threads offering comparable results. The latter is now only done for the pdd fit where it offers significant speed to find a good result. [v16]
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  in SpecialMode2 the scan number is added for a multiscan file. [v17]
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  Sigmoid fitting is now limited to 2 times the \cf3\strike sigmoid fit radius\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=edgedetectionlimit\}\cf0 . [v17]
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  The initial slope of the sigmoid model as calculated from the data should have a minimal value to represent a normal penumbra. [v17]
\par \cf3{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor design change:\cf0  Due to \cf3\strike discontinued support for 80 bit floating point\cf4\strike0\{linkID=1090\}\cf0  values on Windows10/64, in this version a discretisation is built in the way BistroMath decides which points to use for the quadratic filtering and first derivative. Although the calculation differences are far beyond clinical relevance, this effect \i can\i0  change on a random basis which points to include. It will have some influences on field borders, at most 0.03 mm in the supplied test data. This new discretisation will also be used in the upcoming version 4 and therefore will show exactly reproducible result compared with this version. [v17]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: The key shortcut \b <Shift>\b0 +\b <0>\b0  (for the \cf3\strike Preserve original data on export\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=axis_preservation\}\cf0  measurement menu item blocked the usage of ")" for changing the size of the value points of the measurement curve. The new shortcut is \b <Shift>\b0 +\b <\b0 -\b >\b0 .
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: With the \cf3\strike Values\cf4\strike0\{linkID=110\}\cf0  \i off\i0  BistroMath responded on the  \b <left>\b0  and \b <right>\b0  keys with a tab change instead of a cursor change.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: Out of boundary access of data in \i Derive\i0  filter. Did never show up in execution.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: Autoshift in SpecialMode3 messed up alignment. Now fixed.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: \cf3\strike SpecialMode2\cf4\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0  was not working when configured with a curve curve selector due to a different order in the code.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: Opening a binary data file activated the \cf3\strike Ignore Clipboard Item\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=ignore_clipboard\}\cf0  in the File menu.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: When subtracting background, the filtered curve was not updated.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: In some workflows it was possible to start the display of results without a valid filtered version of the measurement data, which is used as base for a lot of result values. Now this is checked an recalculated when needed.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: Integer overflow error when writing wms data from non-wms origin. [v17]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: When Sigmoid analysis was not forced in the settings, invalid results were given with SpecialMode2 output. [v17]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: The sigmoid slope value for the left slope had the wrong sign, leading to poor start and possibly fit faillure. Also a better esitmate is chosen now. [v17]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: The \cf3\strike sigmoid analysis radius\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=edgedetectionlimit\}\cf0  was actually never used but its default value of 10 mm. [v17]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: In subversion 16 an error was introduced by checking on text contents of the clipboard when it had no text format. This lead clipboard error messages. [v18]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug revealed design flaws, introduced by SpecialMode2. When key 'H' was pressed \i and\i0  SpecialMode2 was used \i and\i0  the border position at user's level was asked for in this mode \i and\i0  the user's level was not equal to 50%, the standard 50% level would change because it now showed the user's level result without further notice. This was not foreseen in the evaluation engine and the results panel processing. [v19]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug: In december 2019 the sigmoid slope was added to the result panel rules. In the actual code this would also use the \i un\i0 filtered data as source for the 80-20 penumbra width. It was always intended to use (for the better or worse) the filtered version of the data. The effect is subtle. This is repaired now to make it compatible with the soon upcoming major release in Lazarus/Freepascal. [v20]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}\{26/05/2020 apply variable wInflectionSigmoidRadiusCm instead of fixed constant twcDefSigmoidRadiusCm\}
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Bug repair: While porting the analysis engine in earlier subversions of 330.x an error was introduced in a statistics library, ultimately discarding the results of the derivative function. This also blocked the sigmoid function and messed up the right border of the In-Field area.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Bug repair: Disabling panels (grouped items) on a disabled tab, because they \i looked\i0  enabled, made labels permanently invisible. Now only the color is set to gray. [v15]
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Bug repair: With the setting "Assign origin to all 2D array lines" (currently only implemented for the StarcheckMaxi) switched \i on\i0 , the origin value was not preserved \i for the reference only\i0  when the already available reference data were reused. Instead a zero value was inserted, leading to a sharp edge in the middle and effectively two halved profiles. This is typically the case when the next profile from a multi-profile set is viewed. Now this origin value is both preserved and only used when larger than zero.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Minor bug repair: A change in the \cf3\strike Extendend Symmetry\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=extsym\}\cf0  submenu was not reflected in the Results panel (if Extended Symmetry was defined as panel rule) until this change was stored in a configuration and the program was restarted. Now this is reflected immediately for the next data input.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Some possibly non-printable characters are now avoided on the screen.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}More checks on invalid clipboard data.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Improvement: Now BistroMath checks whether the decimal separator on the Windows system is the point symbol ("."). If not, the program will immediately exit after a message is shown.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Improvement: The triggering of the "user's dose level" annotation is now triggered by both the explicit \cf3\strike menu choice\cf4\strike0\{linkID=44\}\cf0  and the application of the \cf3\strike evaluation type\cf4\strike0\{linkTarget=evaluation_types\}\cf0  "u".
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Improvement: A call to a ClearScreen procedure is guaranteed on reading data through any route, to avoid the impression of a success while the analysis actually failed.
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Speed improvement: to check file types now only once per file the file is opened. Early checks on small clipboard texts which cannot represent any data.

\par \pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200\cf2 Small code improvement:\cf0  The \cf2\strike evaluation type\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=evaluation_types\}\cf0  "u" which calls for the border postiton at \i users\i0  value, in the \cf2\strike SpecialMode2\cf3\strike0\{linkID=910\}\cf0 -configuration can now be extended with any numeric value like "u\i nn\i0 " where \i nn\i0  will be replaced with the used dose level.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Efficiency improvement\cf0 : All raw data are first checked as potentially binary file type and, when not found to be of a known binary type, opened again in text mode. As remnant from the Delphi era both data streams were kept in memory. Now the binary data stream is copied in memory as raw bytes to a text stream. Then the binary stream is emptied, thus also avoiding to open the file twice.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Performance/bug repair: When in the \cf2\strike Measurement menu\cf3\strike0\{linkID=120\}\cf0  \i User Dose Level\i0  was selected as border evaluation level (and a reference was loaded and alignemnet of the reference was chosen), this was not calculated in due time, which sent BistroMath executing an extremely time consuming profile matching procedure, which might also give a subtle different shift result. Alse the field width at \i user's level\i0  failed to present although both borders were available. Now the shortcut of not calculating this value as default during profile analysis is removed. If not used, the user might configure the \cf2\i\strike User Dose Level\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0\i0  to 50%, which is also the default. Then the code will take this already obtained result for maximum efficiency.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}A minor inconsistency was found: The Linac Error calculation still used a fixed d50 border instead of the border definition of the actual Field Type.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Some options, like \i Detect diagonals\i0  and \i Ignore zero steps\i0  were not passed timely to the actually used analysis object (also with no history list), failing some profiles to open.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}For OmniPro v8 files the by OmniPro added text " \cf4\highlight5\lang0\f2 Accelerator\cf0\highlight0\lang1043\f0 " was not chopped off, failing to identify a reference.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}In an attempt to move to standard FreePascal the axis sign correction data were accidently initialised to 0 and not to 1. This might nullify positions also and therefore failing to read the data. At a second attempt this would be repaired.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}A recently introduced feature to chop off zero data points at the end of files (for Varian Eclipse data points outside the body contour) is now limited to depth doses. This intoduced a failure in the selftest.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Files of the w2CAD type failed to read (also found in the selftest).
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}The selftest also failed unexpectedly on the edge detection of wedge profiles. This was tracked down to the derivative function where a valid result was set to invalid. This error was introduced between 2016 and 2018 and also found in the last Delphi releases.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}For a window larger then the minimum required height BistroMath would decrease the height due to a complete rebuild of the results panel every time another tab was selected. Now this instruction, introduced for good measure, is removed again from the tab switching code.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}When application of a reference fails, more details will be given if the loglevel is increased (v.4.05.2).
\par \cf2\strike{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Insertion of the TG line origin\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=insert_origin\}\cf0  in other scan lines for the StarCheckMaxi will be allowed only in DOSE mode (v.4.05.3).

When instead the crossline was shown first \i and\i0  the setting \cf2\i\strike Assign origin to both 2D array lines\cf3\strike0\{linkID=127\}\cf0\i0  was checked, a wrong value for the central detector was applied. Now it is forced that always the first profile of a multi scan file is presented.

\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New\cf0 : BistroMath uses now the SoundEx function to find month text values for multiple languages. For example 'may', 'mai' and 'mei' all give the same soundex function result. Therefore, when text is used for the month, the order 'MDY' and 'DMY' are now working irrespective the real order for day and month.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Small code improvement\cf0 : a temporary reference with lacking information parameters could not be passed through the history list as valid reference, even with \i Check Temporary Scan type\i0  switched off.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Small code improvement\cf0 : Eclipse files with multiple zero-value data points ate the end were found. This might give a large overshoot of the used quadratic filter at the very end of a pdd. This had only effects on the maxium of the graph but annoying anyway. Now those points are chopped off in an early stage.

This is repaired.\cf4 
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Code improvement\cf4 : the history feature did not combine very well the temporary reference feature. Now the the latest temporary reference is transferred to the next data set (when\cf0  not frozen). See \cf2\strike details\cf3\strike0\{linkID=90\}\cf0 . A complete review of the reference loading process was done.

\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New\cf0 : When a large data set is defined as temporary reference, this may take a while. Progress messages will show on the statusbar.

This is a long list as the last 3.30 subversion was published in july 2020.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Due to the \cf2\strike deprecated support of the x87 math processor\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1090\}\cf0  in Windows10/64bits exact reproduction with previous versions before 3.30.18 is not possible.

\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 The profile value at a position as percentage of the border to center of field is introduced (\i Profile Evaluation Point\i0 ) as \cf2\strike evaluation type\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=evaluation_types\}\cf0  "r" / "R" for the results panel and specialmode2.
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 The \cf2\strike first page\cf3\strike0\{linkID=1\}\cf0  of this helpfile contains a clickable image for fast navigation.
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 In the viewing menu an Auto Unzoom item is added for FFF profiles.
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 All menu shortcuts can be changed through the configuration file.
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 The right axis can be \cf2\strike linked to the grid\cf3\strike0\{linkID=110\}\cf0 .
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New: \cf0 A pdf print of the \cf2\strike current window\cf3\strike0\{linkID=50\}\cf0 .
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}New:\cf0  In the \cf2\strike Result Panel rules\cf3\strike0\{linkID=18\}\cf0  two new conditions (N=Standard field type, S=Small field type, see below) and field size limits are introduced.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Changes in configuration file: a lot of elements were renamed. Backward compatibility is guaranteed with on-the-fly conversion. See \cf2\strike configuration issues\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=configuration_files\}\cf0 .
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : The \cf2\strike statusbar\cf3\strike0\{linkID=21\}\cf0  is now split in two parts. At the right side the confirmed scan number in a multi scan file is shown; for a single data set the number of measurement points.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : The right axis labels are now aligned with the left axis grid at the minor costs of less nice numbers.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : The SelfTest is removed from standard release builds although the code is maintained and used during development. Therefore SpecialMode4 is also removed.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : Graph panel, graph grid and general panels (as a group) have configurable colors.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor design change\cf0 : When switching between tabs the shift of a curve is preserved; using \i Load current data\i0  in the \i File\i0  menu does not.
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Design change\cf0 : Edge annotations which reflect the primary edge definition can be suppressed.
\par \cf6{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Design change:\cf0  A \i new information type\i0  is introduced: the \cf2\i\strike Field type\cf3\strike0\{linkID=23\}\cf0\i0 . This replaces the (unnamed) \i default\i0 , \i Wedge\i0  and \i FFF \i0 charcteristic with the new Field types \i Standard\i0 , \i FFF\i0 , \i Small\i0  and \i Wedge\i0 .
\par \cf2{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Design change\cf0 : The \cf2\strike annotation\cf3\strike0\{linkTarget=annotations\}\cf0  for edge values based on the sigmoid inflection point is changed from \b\i s\b0\i0  to \b\i i\b0\i0 nn, where nn is the actual dose level. A new 50%-level based on sigmoid analysis with annotation \b\i s\b0\i0  is introduced. The evaluation types for these choices are 'i' and 'I' respectively. The sigmoid may also be used to find the position at user's level (evalution type 'U').
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: For generic files the measurement option \cf2 Generic to PDD\cf3\{linkTarget=general_detection_strategy\}\cf0  failed.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: The generic data reading object was too picky on empty lines and non-printable characters.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Minor bug fix: On changeover from a single scan to a array scan data set that started with the same scan type, SSD, field size and depth the single scan reference was maintained as "valid". Only when changing to the next scan in the data set the correct reference arrray scan was taken.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Small improvements for the \cf2\strike histogram\cf3\strike0\{linkID=17\}\cf0  presentation to get a better normalisation.
\par {\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}A lot of visual elements have been renamed or replaced with other structures completely.

\par The Omnipro software allows measuring points at irregular positions. Moreover, the measuring speed an therefore the measurement point density may be changed during a scan. This implicates that nowhere a regular interval may be expected which complicates all calculations severely.
\par 
\par \cf2\b\{target=extracting_data\}\cf0 Extracting data from profile\b0 
\par Values like the maximum value or a position at a given level do generally not coincide with one single point in the curve data. Therefore some way of interpolation is needed. A further complication is the noise in the measurements giving need to include more points in the surroundings.
\par Two different methods are used in Bistromath.
\par 
\par \i Linear interpolation\i0 
\par This is done on base of two points: the nearest point and the second nearest point. The interpolation between those two points is straightforward. This method is used for \cf3\strike matching\cf2\strike0\{linkID=144\}\cf0  two curves and \cf3\strike merging\cf2\strike0\{linkID=72\}\cf0  two curves. In those case the goal is to stay as closely to the raw data as possible.
\par 
\par \i Quadratic fit\i0 
\par When final analysis results need to be calculated, a best estimate is wanted for a noisy dataset. Therefore a number of points is taken in the neighbourhood of the nearest point. The number of points is derived from the (average) step size and user defined range called the \cf3\i\strike Calculation width\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=calculationwidth\}\cf0\i0 .   This closely resembles the quadratic filter, which uses its own \cf3\strike calculation range\cf2\strike0\{linkTarget=filterwidth\}\cf0 .

\par The Omnipro software allows measuring points at irregular positions. Moreover, the measuring speed an therefore the measurement point density may be changed during a scan. This implicates that nowhere a regular interval may be expected which complicates all calculations severely. On this page relevant calculation details are explained and shown in (slightly simplified) Delphi code.\strike

\par The Omnipro software allows measuring points at irregular positions. Moreover, the measuring speed an therefore the measurement point density may be changed during a scan. This implicates that nowhere a regular interval may be expected which complicates all calculations severely. On this page relevant calculation details are explained and shown in (slightly simplified) Delphi code.\strike

\par This function is original work of Theo van Soest.
\par A complete gamma analysis produces for each measured point
\par -the dose difference (DD) with the reference (optionally with interpolation)
\par -the distance to agreement (DTA)
\par -the shortest vector (Gamma) in dose/position space scaled to unit vectors \{n\}% dose and \{d\} mm distance.
\par DD might be scaled to a global level or local dose.
\par The shortest vector should be found with some interpolation mechanism after a searching step.
\par For 1D data sets as in this unit this is relatively simple: from a number of point the Gamma value is interpolated.
\par Any gamma analysis implementation needs a number of parameters and makes interpolation choices. Therefore each implementation is different.
\par In this implementation
\par -twcGammaLocalDosePerc   : use local dose
\par -twcGammaCutoffPercent   : cutoff for profiles
\par -twcGammaCutoffDepth     : cutoff depth for pdd
\par -twcGammaDistCmStep      : step size for searching between measurerment points
\par -twcGammaSearchMultiplier: limit search to Gamma-value at distance 0 multiplied with this factor
\par -twcGammaDosePercBase    : unit vector for dose
\par -twcGammaDistCmBase      : unit vecor distance

\par The conversion from Ionisation to Dose is only valid for electron beam data measured with a ionisation chamber. This should not be applied to diode or likewise solid state detectors. The detection of the detector type is unreliable and therefore ignored. The conversion is actively limited to unconverted depth dose curves or fanline curves of a electron beam or undefined beam. See also the \cf3\strike scientific backgrounds\cf2\strike0\{linkID=125\}\cf0 .

\par   The water to air mass stopping power ratios vary considerably with depth and in order to
\par   derive a depth dose curve from a measured depth ionisation curve with an ionisation
\par   chamber stopping power data as a function of beam quality and depth are needed. Burns et
\par   al. [31] derived from the same Monte Carlo simulations that led to equation (35) a more
\par   complicated equation for these data.
\par   Rogers [74] showed that for a wide range of accelerators these data are accurate to within
\par   1.0% except at very shallow depths or depths beyond 1.1 z/R50.
\par 
\par   Calculation of R50,dose from R50,ion (page 25):
\par   When departing from an ionisation curve, R50,dos is derived
\par   from R50,ion, the 50% ionisation level beyond the ionisation maximum, using the following
\par   generic expressions [32].

\par Several calculations are based on filtered versions of a profile. Also the presented analysis results are based on such a "Calculated" curve. This filtering is done with a moving window in which the central point is calculated with a second order polynomal function. This gives excellent results and preserves positional information in the penumbral area. The number of points is calculated from a given filterwidth in cm and the average stepsize. \cf3\strike The filterwidth can be configured\cf2\strike0\{linkID=4\}\cf0 .
\par The derivative is calculated by aquiring the slope of a linear fit on the local data.
\par 
\par \b\i Filters
\par \cf1\b0\i0\f2 
\par \cf0\f1 The quadratic filter fits a second order polynome on the area of the calculation point. Only the central value of this fit is used. There is an elaborate fallback strategy, based on statistical analysis to suppress outliers. For sparse data sets this has proven to be a good addition.\cf1\f2

\par   The height of sss to rrr is determined by NormFactor.
\par   For a too large value of NormFactor the sum of differences (over all points)
\par   sss-rrr will be positive and for a too low value negative.

\par \pard\lang1043\b\f0 Introduction\b0 
\par Mirosoft has annouced not to support the x87 coprocessor on the Windows 10/64 bits platform. Its use is deprecated and can be stopped in the future. This can be relevant with context changes (i.e. the processor is going to do something else) and not all registers are preserved. However there are still a large number of 32 bits applications that need to be supported. The 80 bits extended floating point is dependent on the registers in the x87 coprocessor.
\par A text value like '9.1' will be converted to exactly 9.1 on the Delphi 32 bits platform using the \i Extended\i0  80 bits type.
\par 
\par \b Freepascal uses 64 bits\b0 
\par Freepascal (FPC) follows the formal statements and silently changes the still existing \i Extended\i0  to the \i Double\i0  type, a 64 bits floating point type.
\par Now the FPC StrToFloat function will produce 9.09999999999996 for the string '9.1'. For other string values the actual numerical value migth be just over the intended value.\f1 
\par 
\par \b\f0 So what?\b0 
\par BistroMath uses the distance between points to decide whether they are used to contribute to the local filtered value:
\par      \f2  \cf3\b while Abs(twPosCm[P1]-twPosCm[Pc])>cm2 do\cf0\b0\f0 
\par When points have a perfect regular spacing, in the distance between two positions there still is introduced a randomness by the 64 bits truncations which might make the difference a little bit smaller or larger. To avoid incomparable results a new discrete comparison is introduced in Delphi version 3.30.17 which can also be used in FPC:
\par      \f2  \cf3\b while Round(twcDefDiscretisationMult*Abs(twPosCm[P1]-twPosCm[Pc]))>kcm2 do\cf0\b0\f0 
\par This enables to show that both versions really perform identical.\f1
